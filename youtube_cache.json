DeepSeek, as the lab is called, unveiled a free, open-source large-language model in late December that it says took only two months and less than $6 million to build.  The new developments have raised alarms on whether America‚Äôs global lead in artificial intelligence is shrinking and called into question big tech‚Äôs massive spend on building AI models and data centers. In a set of third-party benchmark tests, DeepSeek‚Äôs model outperformed Meta‚Äôs Llama 3.1, OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o and Anthropic‚Äôs Claude Sonnet 3.5 in accuracy ranging from complex problem-solving to math and coding.

When a new friend needs his help, Li enters a karate competition ‚Äì but his skills alone aren't enough. Li's kung fu teacher Mr. Han (Jackie Chan) enlists original Karate Kid Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio) for help, and Li learns a new way to fight, merging their two styles into one for the ultimate martial arts showdown.\n\nKarate Kid: Legends is produced by Karen Rosenfelt.

She speaks with remarkable honesty about finding unconditional love after believing she never would, making the first move in her relationship, and the importance of speaking up against unfair practices.

        "description": "In recent years, the cost of cars in India has been steadily rising, creating significant challenges for the middle class. What was once considered a luxury item has now become a near-essential mode of transportation, yet the affordability gap continues to widen. The increasing car prices can be attributed to several complex factors that impact the overall cost structure.\n\nTaxation plays a crucial role in determining car prices in India. The government levies multiple taxes, including Goods and Services Tax (GST), road tax, registration charges, and additional state-specific levies. These taxes can add substantial amounts to the base price of a vehicle. For instance, the GST rates vary between 5% and 28% depending on the type and value of the car, significantly inflating the final price.\nManufacturing costs have also risen due to several factors. \n\nThe implementation of stricter safety and emission norms requires manufacturers to invest in advanced technologies and more sophisticated manufacturing processes. Additionally, raw material costs, including steel, aluminum, and electronic components, have increased globally. The transition towards electric and hybrid vehicles has further pushed up development and production expenses.\n\nImport duties on crucial components and the need for localization add another layer of complexity to pricing. While the government encourages domestic manufacturing through initiatives like Make in India, the automotive supply chain still faces challenges that contribute to higher costs.\n\nThe result is a challenging landscape for middle-class consumers, who find themselves stretching their budgets to own a vehicle that has become increasingly necessary for daily life in India's rapidly developing urban and suburban environments.",

        "description": "Join Learner's Community : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmfl6VteCu880D8Txl4vEag/join\nOfficial Website - Courses & Learning Materials : https://www.financeboosan.in  \n\nClubbing of Income Under Indian Tax Laws\nClubbing of Income refers to the inclusion of another person's income in the taxpayer's total income for tax computation purposes. This concept is aimed at preventing tax evasion by taxpayers who might otherwise transfer their income or assets to others, typically family members, to reduce their tax liability.\n\nThe provisions governing clubbing of income are outlined in Sections 60 to 64 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Here‚Äôs an overview:\n\n1. Transfer of Income without Transfer of Assets (Section 60)\nIf a person transfers income from an asset to another person without transferring the ownership of the asset, the income from such an asset is taxed in the hands of the transferor.\nExample: If Mr. A owns a property and transfers the rental income to his spouse without transferring the property itself, the rental income will still be taxed in Mr. A's hands.\n\n2. Revocable Transfer of Assets (Section 61)\nIf a person transfers an asset under a revocable arrangement, the income from such an asset will be taxed in the hands of the transferor.\nA revocable transfer is one where the transferor retains the right to reclaim the asset or income.\nExample: Mr. A transfers a property to his son but retains the right to revoke the transfer. In such a case, the income from the property is taxed in Mr. A's hands.\n\n3. Income of Spouse (Section 64(1)(ii))\nIf an individual‚Äôs spouse earns income from an entity where the individual has substantial interest, and the spouse does not possess technical or professional qualifications, the income is clubbed with the income of the individual.\nSubstantial interest typically means holding at least 20% of the equity shares or profits in the entity.\nExample: Mrs. A works in a company where Mr. A has a 30% shareholding. If Mrs. A has no technical or professional qualification for the job, her salary will be clubbed with Mr. A‚Äôs income.\n\n4. Income from Assets Transferred to Spouse (Section 64(1)(iv))\nIncome from assets transferred directly or indirectly to the spouse without adequate consideration is clubbed with the income of the transferor, except where the asset is transferred under an agreement to live apart.\nExample: If Mr. A gifts a house to Mrs. A, the rental income from the house will be taxed in Mr. A‚Äôs hands.\n\n5. Income from Assets Transferred to Son‚Äôs Wife (Section 64(1)(vi))\nIf an individual transfers assets to their son's wife without adequate consideration, the income from such assets is clubbed with the income of the transferor.\nExample: Mr. A gifts shares to his daughter-in-law. The dividend income from these shares will be taxed in Mr. A‚Äôs hands.\n\n6. Income of Minor Child (Section 64(1A))\nThe income of a minor child is clubbed with the income of the parent whose total income (excluding the child‚Äôs income) is greater.\nThere are certain exceptions where the child‚Äôs income is not clubbed, such as income earned by a minor from manual work, or from an activity involving the minor‚Äôs talent, or income of a minor child suffering from a disability as specified under Section 80U.\nThe parent can claim an exemption of up to ‚Çπ1,500 per child per year on the income that is clubbed.\n\n7. Implications of Clubbing of Income\nClubbing can lead to a higher tax liability since the income is added to the transferor‚Äôs total income.\nThe clubbed income is taxed at the transferor's applicable slab rate, which might be higher than that of the recipient.\n\n8. Prevention of Misuse\nThe provisions are designed to prevent misuse, such as transferring assets or income to relatives in lower tax brackets to reduce the overall tax burden.\nThe tax authorities are vigilant in ensuring that these rules are not circumvented through artificial transactions.\n\nConclusion\nThe concept of clubbing of income plays a significant role in ensuring that tax liabilities are not reduced unfairly through the transfer of assets or income. It is important for taxpayers to understand these provisions to comply with tax laws and avoid penalties or additional taxes. Proper tax planning and consultation with a tax professional can help manage these aspects effectively.\n\n(Courtesy ChatGPT)\n\nCan you save tax by transferring to Wife's account?\n\nSocial Media\nWhatsapp Channel : https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va6xVGJ1iUxff71r8p23\nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/finance.boosan/\n\nNew Account opening link for SIP and Stock Investments  : \nZerodha  :  https://bit.ly/newZerodhaD\n\nVideo Editor : https://www.instagram.com/jagan_editor/\n\n\n#financeBoosan #personalfinance \nStock Market, Mutual Funds, Investments, Personal Finance, Make Money Online",

        "title": "Multi-cap funds: A smarter way to invest in mid and small caps?",
        "description": "Mid-cap and small-cap funds are among the most sought-after mutual funds. However, their high volatility is a problem. In this video, we find out if multi-cap funds can be a better way to invest in mid and small caps. \n\nMulti-cap funds are required to invest at least 25% of their assets each in large, mid and small caps. So, at any point, they have 50% assets invested in mid and small caps. Their large-cap exposure helps provide the required stability. So, multi-cap funds can be both rewarding and less volatile.\n\nFew other diversified categories provide this return mix. For example, flexi-cap funds tend to be large-cap heavy and large & mid-cap funds tend to be underweight in small caps. So, multi-cap funds are in a distinguished position.\n\nBut the analysis of multi-cap funds is not easy as they came into being only in 2021. They have an interesting history that you can learn more about in the video. So, to analyse these funds, we had to create a multi-cap fund. We did so by taking the Nifty 100, Nifty Midcap 150 and Nifty Smallcap 250 total-return indices and then allocating assets to them as per the asset allocation of multi-cap funds over the last 2 years. We also rebalanced the resulting proxy multi-cap fund on a yearly basis.\n\nWe then compared the performance of this proxy multi-cap fund with the mid-cap and small-cap indices. The comparison revealed that not only did the proxy multi-cap fund do considerably well on the returns front but it also offered less volatility and better downside protection. \n\nThough the study had its limitations, it can be concluded that multi-cap funds can be a good way to invest in mid and small caps. Plus, they can also take care of asset allocation across market caps.\n\n#ETMoney\n\nüëâ To invest in Direct Plans of top Mutual Funds for free, download the ET Money app: https://etmoney.onelink.me/unJQ/5ca1ae3b \n\nüëâ Subscribe to ET Money Hindi\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzWtyDo9KmEC1JoAqa1LIEw\n\nüëâ Read more such informative articles at https://www.etmoney.com/blog\n\nüëâ Follow us on: \n‚ñ∫ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ETMONEY/ \n‚ñ∫ Twitter: https://twitter.com/etmoney \n‚ñ∫ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/etmoney_official/\n‚ñ∫ LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/et_money/",

        "description": "For the first time in more than two decades Mexico overtook China as the largest importer of goods to the U.S.\n\nMexican goods imported to the U.S. totaled $475 billion in 2023 about $20 billion higher than the previous year. Feuling that trend are simmering trade tensions between Beijing and Washington, an effort to bring U.S. imports closer to home and a burgeoning Mexican manufacturing base.

        "description": "Subscribe for more: https://www.youtube.com/@remoterish?sub_confirmation=1\n\nIn this video, I challenge the popular concept of forever buying and holding mutual funds. \n\nWhile many investors follow this advice, I believe it's unrealistic. \n\nEvery year, you see a new list of top mutual funds across large-cap, mid-cap, flexi-cap, and more. If the list keeps changing, how can anyone expect to buy and hold a fund forever?\n\nI explain why mutual funds constantly evolve, with fund managers changing, strategies shifting, and market cycles turning. \n\nOver time, these factors can dramatically affect your returns. In contrast, index funds provide a much more stable option for long-term investing. \n\nWith index funds, the role of the fund manager is minimal, and the portfolio simply tracks the top companies in the market, making them more reliable for holding over the long term. \n\nThere's no need to worry about constant shifts in performance or new funds entering the spotlight every year.\n\nI explore why index funds are easier to hold forever, how they minimize the emotional and strategic noise that comes from market speculation, and why this approach works better for long-term wealth building. \n\nI also touch on why it's crucial to avoid being swayed by flashy marketing from mutual funds, which often promise high returns but require constant attention and changes to your strategy.\n\nIf you're someone who's aiming to build a long-term portfolio with minimal intervention and wants to stay focused on the core principles of compounding, this video will give you a practical guide on how to achieve that through index investing.\n\nKey Takeaways:\nThe myth of holding mutual funds forever.\nHow index funds offer simplicity and stability.\nWhy market noise from fund managers can disrupt long-term plans.\nThe power of sticking with funds that change the least.\n\n‚Äî\nLinks:\nüíº Connect on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/rishabhdev/\nüì∏ Follow on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/remoterish/\nüåü Join on X: https://x.com/reachrishabh\n\nüöÄ Join my WhatsApp Community: https://bit.ly/freedom-investing\nüì© Sign up for my Newsletter: https://bit.ly/rishabh-dev-newsletter\n\nüîî Turn on notifications to stay updated with new uploads",

        "description": "A lot of smart investors use the SIP-plus-lump sum strategy for better returns. They maintain an ongoing SIP in mutual funds, and when markets fall, they invest a lump sum amount to benefit from market corrections. Recently, on 4th June, we saw markets fall close to 6% following unexpected election results. On that day, many investors seized the opportunity to invest lump sums, aiming to capitalize on the correction.\n\nBut does this strategy work? In this video, we dive deep into the data to find surprising answers. We'll explore three key aspects: the type of correction (whether to invest when markets fall or when valuations are low), the size of the correction (ideal investment points at 5%, 10%, or 15% drops), and the optimal investment horizon to maximize returns with this strategy. Watch the video to discover which combination of variables produces the highest returns and how you can optimize your investment strategy.\n\nChapters\n00:00 Introduction\n02:00 Key assumptions taken for the analysis\n04:28 Buying on dips - easy way to earn more returns?\n\n#ETMoney\n\nüëâ To invest in Direct Plans of top Mutual Funds for free, download the ET Money app: https://etmoney.onelink.me/unJQ/5ca1ae3b \n\nüëâ Subscribe to ET Money Hindi\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzWtyDo9KmEC1JoAqa1LIEw\n\nüëâ 5 Minute Finance channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@5-Minute-Finance\n\nüëâ Learn about Investments, Tax-Saving and Future Planning  https://www.etmoney.com/learn\n\nüëâ Follow us on: \n‚ñ∫ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ETMONEY/ \n‚ñ∫ Twitter: https://twitter.com/etmoney \n‚ñ∫ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/etmoney_official/\n‚ñ∫ LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/et_money/\n‚ñ∫ Whatsapp: https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaB4nh0HltY56g6cA81b",

        "title": "How Amazon Failed to Understand India? - Business Case Study",
        "description": "00:00 - Intro\n02:00 - Arrival in India\n03:21 - Strategy in India\n06:16 - How is it Failing?\n12:05 - Future of Amazon\n\nAmazon's journey in India has been marked by both promise and challenges. In 2015, Jeff Bezos declared India as Amazon‚Äôs most crucial market after the US. India, with its rapid economic growth and emerging e-commerce landscape, appeared to be a perfect opportunity for Amazon to extend its global dominance. Initially, Amazon invested heavily, pouring over $5 billion into its operations, and significantly shaping the country‚Äôs e-commerce sector alongside Flipkart. Amazon's infrastructure, customer experience, and seller services helped the company gain a strong foothold, especially in tier-1 cities, positioning it as a major player in India's e-commerce landscape.\n\nHowever, in recent years, Amazon's growth in India has slowed, and it is facing significant competition from newer players like Meesho, Zepto, and Blinkit. In FY-23, Amazon India‚Äôs revenue grew by only 3.4%, the slowest growth in its history. One of the primary reasons for this slowdown is the shift in India‚Äôs e-commerce landscape. India is not a homogenous market but is divided into different segments based on income and consumption patterns, often referred to as India 1, India 2, and India 3. Amazon initially targeted the premium segment, India 1, which accounted for a small portion of the population but the majority of the country's consumption. However, by 2017, this segment started reaching saturation, and the growth in e-commerce began shifting towards tier-2 and tier-3 cities (India 2 and 3), which have different needs and behaviors.\n\nThe arrival of Reliance Jio and the subsequent rise of internet penetration brought millions of new consumers from smaller towns online. These consumers, however, were more price-sensitive and less familiar with online shopping, and Amazon failed to adapt quickly to their needs. Meesho capitalized on this gap by introducing innovative solutions, such as selling through WhatsApp groups and enabling local resellers, which built trust and made online shopping accessible for this new wave of customers. Meesho‚Äôs zero-commission model and faster payment cycles for sellers also gave it a competitive advantage, especially among smaller sellers.\n\nAnother challenge for Amazon is the rise of quick commerce in India. Post-pandemic, companies like Blinkit revolutionized the market by offering 10-minute grocery and product deliveries. This sector, which didn‚Äôt exist a few years ago, is growing at an explosive rate, with Blinkit already being valued at $13 billion‚Äîhalf of Amazon India's valuation. While Amazon has always prided itself on fast delivery, it has yet to make significant moves into the quick commerce space, leaving it vulnerable to competitors.\n\nFurthermore, government regulations have added to Amazon's difficulties. India‚Äôs regulatory environment is increasingly cautious of foreign dominance in crucial sectors like e-commerce. In 2019, new rules prevented companies like Amazon from selling products from brands in which they held a stake, forcing Amazon to remove hundreds of thousands of products from its platform. The Indian government‚Äôs push for a more open and competitive e-commerce sector, through initiatives like ONDC, also threatens Amazon's future in the country.\n\nIn response to these challenges, Amazon is now shifting focus to other sectors, such as cloud computing and digital payments. However, Amazon‚Äôs core e-commerce business remains essential to its overall strategy, as it serves as the distribution network for its other ventures. If the company cannot regain its momentum in e-commerce, its ability to expand into new areas may also be hampered. Despite the setbacks, the future of Amazon in India remains uncertain, and it will need to rethink its approach to compete in this rapidly changing market.\n\nConnect with us:\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bwmillionaires/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/backstagewithmillionaires/\nPodcast: https://open.spotify.com/show/5rGPalovc6AKsfbOyjh32p\n\n#amazon #zomato #jeffbezos #zepto #blinkit",

        "title": "How Namma Yatri Ended Ola and Uber's Dominance?",
        "description": "The video discusses the challenges faced by drivers working for cab-hailing services like Ola and Uber in India, particularly regarding commissions and delayed payments. It talks about a new business model introduced by Namma Yatri, a part of the government-led ONDC, aimed at addressing these issues. This model eliminates commissions and instead charges drivers a fixed subscription fee, offering them more control over their earnings and immediate payment from customers. Since its launch, this model has gained significant traction, with over 3 lakh drivers joining Namma Yatri, leading to its expansion into other cities.\n\nThe success of Namma Yatri's zero-commission model has put pressure on traditional players like Ola and Uber to adopt similar strategies. Rapido, another cab-hailing service, was the first to adopt this model, prompting Ola and Uber to follow suit to avoid losing drivers to competitors. This shift signifies a significant disruption in the cab-hailing industry, challenging the dominance of Ola and Uber and potentially reshaping the market dynamics.\n\nFurthermore, Namma Yatri has announced plans to enter the cab-hailing business in Bengaluru, further intensifying competition in the sector. This move poses a significant threat to Ola and Uber, which have established themselves over the years. Ola, in particular, is gearing up for an IPO, adding more pressure on the company to adapt to changing market trends.\n\nConnect with us:\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bwmillionaires/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/backstagewithmillionaires/\nPodcast: https://open.spotify.com/show/5rGPalovc6AKsfbOyjh32p\n\n#nammayatri #startup #entrepreneur",

That money is now worth 3.7 Billion dollars, a staggering 217x return on investment. \n\nSanjeev‚Äôs other successful bet was in PolicyBazaar, a company he has backed since 2007. His investment in the company of 69 Million dollars, is now worth 1.02 Billion dollars. \n\nBut the question is, how did he achieve this?\n\nIn one word, the answer is ‚Äòpatience‚Äô. See, a typical VC firm has a fund cycle of 10 years, which means they have to exit before that. \n\nBut the Indian market takes longer periods to give big returns, almost 15 years in these two cases.\n\nAnd because of this reason, other VC firms like Sequoia and Softbank exited Zomato soon after its IPO and couldn‚Äôt make big returns.",

        "description": "LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs, used to create agent and multi-agent workflows. Compared to other LLM frameworks, it offers these core benefits: cycles, controllability, and persistence. LangGraph allows you to define flows that involve cycles, essential for most agentic architectures, differentiating it from DAG-based solutions. As a very low-level framework, it provides fine-grained control over both the flow and state of your application, crucial for creating reliable agents. Additionally, LangGraph includes built-in persistence, enabling advanced human-in-the-loop and memory features.\nCode Link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1S9Hvp6XrJ_Jy_vWt1MBXKnOvfxS9Z4oE?usp=sharing\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCheck out my Udemy Course\nData Analyst Bootcamp:https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-data-analyst-bootcamp-from-basics-to-advanced/?couponCode=EDB0ADCCE272C2190C14\n\nMathematics Basics to Advanced for Data Science \n\nhttps://www.udemy.com/course/mathematics-basics-to-advanced-for-data-science-and-ml/?couponCode=D3ED31D3AE79D1CCEF99\n\nComplete Maching Learning, NLP Bootcamp With Deployment :https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-machine-learning-nlp-bootcamp-mlops-deployment/?couponCode=70D09C7863B20DA2E9E3\n\n\nComplete Generative AI with Langchain and Huggignface : https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-generative-ai-course-with-langchain-and-huggingface/?couponCode=34430E70BDA0494ECC21\n\nBuilding GenAI apps 12+ end to end projects :https://www.udemy.com/course/building-gen-ai-app-end-to-end-projects-with-gemini-pro/?couponCode=915C77B734393B72C80E\n\n\nMastering Figma from 0 to 100 : https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-figma-from-0-to-100/?couponCode=ED932A4592EBACB50D17",

Most of those twisters are touching down in the central part of the country in an area called ‚ÄúTornado Alley.‚Äù While the boundaries of this tornado hotbed are disputed, there‚Äôs no denying that something is going on here ‚Äî and it all has to do with geography. \n\nThe map we use in this video for Tornado Alley boundaries is from NOAA ‚Äî you can find that and more information on their website: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/climate-information/extreme-events/us-tornado-climatology/tornado-alley\n\nInformation on tornado averages and trends can also be found at NOAA:\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/climate-information/extreme-events/us-tornado-climatology/trends\n\nYou may have noticed on our graphic around the one-minute mark that many of the Southeastern US states are prone to tornadoes as well. This is because they‚Äôre part of an area called ‚ÄúDixie Alley.‚Äù The main difference between this area and Tornado Alley that tornadoes in Dixie Alley are more likely to touch down in the fall, while Tornado Alley experiences twisters in the early spring. This happens for the reasons outlined in the video above. This article offers a fairly compelling comparison of the two: \nhttp://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.660.5241&rep=rep1&type=pdf\n\nFinally, this video offered a simplified explanation of a really complex weather phenomenon. This National Geographic article does a really great job breaking it down again and also offers information on why it‚Äôs so hard to track and predict tornadoes:\nhttps://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/05/150511-tornadoes-storms-midwest-weather-science/\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Directed by Lee Isaac Chung, the Oscar¬Æ nominated writer-director of Minari, Twisters stars Daisy Edgar-Jones (Where the Crawdads Sing), Glen Powell (Top Gun: Maverick) and Anthony Ramos (Transformers: Rise of the Beasts) as equal forces, with opposing motivations, who come together to try to predict, and possibly tame, the immense power of tornadoes.\n\nEdgar-Jones stars as Kate Carter, a former storm chaser haunted by a devastating encounter with a tornado during her college years who now studies storm patterns on screens safely in New York City. She is lured back to the open plains by her friend, Javi (Ramos) to test a groundbreaking new tracking system. There, she crosses paths with Tyler Owens (Powell), the charming and reckless social-media superstar who thrives on posting his storm-chasing adventures with his raucous crew, the more dangerous the better.\n \nAs storm season intensifies, terrifying phenomena never seen before are unleashed, and Kate, Tyler, Javi and their crews find themselves squarely in the paths of multiple storm systems converging over central Oklahoma in the fight of their lives.\n\nTwisters features an exciting new cast, including Nope‚Äôs Brandon Perea, Golden Globe winner Maura Tierney (Beautiful Boy), Sasha Lane (American Honey), Harry Hadden-Paton (The Crown), David Corenswet (We Own This City), Daryl McCormack (Peaky Blinders), Tunde Adebimpe (Leave the World Behind), Katy O‚ÄôBrian (Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania), Nik Dodani (Atypical), Kiernan Shipka (Chilling Adventures of Sabrina) and Paul Scheer (Black Monday).\n\nFrom Amblin, Twisters is directed by Lee Isaac Chung and is produced by Oscar¬Æ nominee Frank Marshall (Jurassic and Indiana Jones franchises) and by Patrick Crowley (Jurassic and Bourne franchises). The screenplay is by Mark L. Smith, writer of the Best Picture nominee The Revenant, from a story by Joseph Kosinski (Oblivion), based on characters created by Michael Crichton & Anne Marie Crichton. The executive producers are Academy Award¬Æ winner Steven Spielberg, Thomas Hayslip and Ashley Jay Sandberg. Twisters will be distributed by Universal Pictures domestically and by Warner Bros. Pictures internationally. \n\nFollow us on Facebook at https://www.facebook.com/twistersmovie\nFind us on Instagram at https://www.instagram.com/twistersmovie/\nFollow us on Twitter at https://twitter.com/Twistersmovie\nFollow us on TikTok at https://www.tiktok.com/@twistersmovie\nhttps://www.twisters-movie.com/\n#TwistersMovie\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@twistersthealbum\nhttps://www.instagram.com/twistersthealbum/\nhttps://twitter.com/twistersalbum\nhttps://www.facebook.com/twistersthealbum\n\nTwisters: The Album available everywhere July 19.

Texas Power Crisis. \n\nüá∫üá∏ Energy Crisis of USA\nSomeone said there is no power cut in the USA üá∫üá∏ What a joke. \nUSA's Power Grid is so old. A 98-year-old hook had caused a wildfire. \nUtility companies like P&GE are going bankrupt trying to fix their equipment. \nThe whole country is struggling to meet the energy requirements. \nWith more electric cars on the road, people are putting extreme loads on the power grid. \n\nüá∫üá∏ Timed Meter!\nIn Bay Area, California where I live. I charge my car only during the night. Because electricity is very very expensive during day time! \nYes, there is a timed meter at my home. \nI have programmed to charge my Tesla only after 12midnight.\nI will plug it in during the day, but it will start charging only after 12 midnight. \n\nüáÆüá≥In India, where the new powerlines are laid under the ground. \nüá∫üá∏But in the USA, so many homes have overhead power cables. \n\nüá∫üá∏Long Ago\nSince the USA started creating electricity lines so long ago. They did not think through a good solution. They laid miles and miles of overhead power lines, which is susceptible to extreme weather conditions. \n\nüá∫üá∏Climate Change\nWith increasing extreme weather conditions all around the USA, the cables are falling down. \n\nüá∫üá∏Labor\nFurthermore,  Labor is very expensive in the USA. Government and Utility contractors could not finish their jobs on time due to a lack of skilled labor. \n\nüá∫üá∏Immigration:\nThe country's leaders are refusing to make a comprehensive immigration change. This condition is only going to get worse. The USA lacks the know-how, skills, and physical labor to fix the infrastructure. \n\nThis is my opinion only. Please do your own research. \n\n- Hobby Explorer \n\nüá∫üá∏‡ÆÖ‡ÆÆ‡ØÜ‡Æ∞‡Æø‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡Ææ-‡Æ≤ ‚ö°Ô∏èüîãüîå‡ÆÆ‡Æø‡Æ©‡Øç‡Æö‡Ææ‡Æ∞ ‡Æ®‡ØÜ‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡Æü‡Æø. ‡Æ™‡Æ¥‡Øà‡ÆØ ‡Æ™‡Æµ‡Æ∞‡Øç

        "description": "Distributed locking is a key concept in ensuring data integrity and consistency in distributed systems. In this video we explore distributed locking mechanisms including centralized locking, token-based locking, and quorum-based locking, explaining their principles, advantages, and limitations.\n\nWe then look into Redis based Redlock, a widely adopted quorum-based locking algorithm that provides high availability and fault tolerance. We break down the Redlock algorithm step by step, highlighting how it leverages multiple Redis instances to achieve consensus on lock acquisition.\n\nThroughout the video, I emphasize the importance of distributed locking in maintaining data integrity and preventing conflicts in concurrent systems. \n\nWe also discuss real-world applications of distributed locking, such as managing inventory in e-commerce systems and coordinating access to shared resources in cloud environments.\n\nFOLLOW ME ON:\n‚ñ∂Ô∏è Main Channel:  /bytemonk  \n\nTimestamps - \n00:00 - Introduction\n01:11 - Distributed Lock\n01:55 - Optimistic vs. Distributed Locking\n03:14 - Ideal Distributed Locking\n03:41 - Distributed Locking Algorithms\n06:59 - Distributed Locking with Redis\n\n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/bytemonk/\n\nSystem Design Interview Basics Playlist: \n‚ñ∫https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJq-63ZRPdBt423WbyAD1YZO0Ljo1pzvY\n\nAWS Certification: \n‚ñ∫AWS Certified Cloud Practioner: https://youtu.be/wF1pldkQrOY\n‚ñ∫AWS Certified Solution Architect Associate: https://youtu.be/GzomXNLFgkk\n‚ñ∫AWS Certified Solution Architect Professional: https://youtu.be/KFZrBxSA9tI\n\n#locking #redis #ai #optimistic",

        "description": "Earn Cash Back On Stocks: Up To $5,000 Per Year\nhttps://www.silomarkets.com/logic/\n\nStripe is one of the fastest-growing startups we‚Äôve seen in the mobile era. They‚Äôve grown from $0 to $1 trillion in annual payments processed within just 14 years. This is especially impressive given that they entered a highly competitive industry dominated by giants such as Mastercard, Visa, PayPal, and American Express. Yet, despite the odds, Stripe managed to grow to a valuation of nearly $100 billion. Their secret was simple: going after a different target market. They tailor-made Stripe to be extremely easy to use for developers. In fact, you only needed 7 lines of code to integrate Stripe into any website. Nowadays, they even have no code options. Aside from simplifying the integration process, Stripe targeted smaller websites and local stores that the bigger players generally overlooked. And as these businesses exploded in popularity, so did Stripe. This video explains the insane rise of Stripe and how Stripe became one of the most successful startups in the world. \n\nFree Weekly Newsletter With Insiders:\nhttps://logicallyanswered.co/\n\nSocials:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/hariharan.jayakumar/\n\nDiscord Community: \nhttps://discord.gg/SJUNWNt\n\nTimestamps:\n0:00 - Stripe\n1:15 - Humble Beginnings\n4:38 - The Genius Of Stripe\n7:24 - Organic Growth\n9:26 - Stripe‚Äôs Secret Sauce\n\nResources:\nhttps://pastebin.com/HJa5TLib\n\nDisclaimer:\nThis video is not a solicitation or personal financial advice.

It also gave birth to two young orphans - Bikram and Bala. They witnessed the war and its aftermath, where the world tried to trample over them. Fighting for survival, they clung to each other and escaped to Calcutta.\n\nBefore they knew the world, they knew each other. Such was their bond, such was their friendship.\n\nEach time they sought new beginnings, each time they would rise, the world would crush them down. So, they fought again... and again. Together they were unbeatable. They were unstoppable. They were inseparable.\n\nIn the years that passed, Bikram and Bala, became Calcutta's most loved, most celebrated, most reckless, most fearless and most powerful GUNDAY!\n\nThey had everything... then, one fine day, bells rang...\n\nNandita, the most beautiful cabaret dancer, walked into their lives, and they lost everything to her. Their murky world turned magical and colourful. They fell head over heels in love with her.\n\nBut that was only a blissful lull before an impending storm...\n\nAnd then entered ACP Satyajeet Sarkar, the right for every wrong, a law for every outlaw and a counter force for Bikram and Bala.\n\nWhat follows from here is the most sensational-most thrilling-most dramatic story ever told!\n\n#YRFnewreleases #Gunday #YRF #RanveerSingh #ArjunKapoor #PriyankaChopra #IrrfanKhan #AliAbbasZafar #SohailSen #IrshadKamil #VishalDadlani #KK #NeetiMohan #BappiLahiri\n\n¬© Yash Raj Films Pvt.

But the path is filled with obstacles. What does India need to fix before it can take China‚Äôs crown? \n\nRead the full story: https://trib.al/Ubb7SZX\n\nHow Narendra Modi Took Power in India: https://youtu.be/FLQoCNzoT2o Originally published May 15, 2024\n\nNarendra Modi, India‚Äôs 73-year-old prime minister, is both highly popular and deeply polarizing. How did he work his way to the top of Indian politics, and what do his policies mean for the country‚Äôs future, both at home and on the world stage?\n\nBloomberg Originals speaks with childhood friends, government officials and former associates who have seen Modi up close over the years, seeking to understand how his core beliefs may have shaped his decision-making. We also show how he has sought to simultaneously make himself a champion of the poor and a friend to billionaires.\n\nSitting at the top of the world‚Äôs most populous nation and one of its fastest growing economies, Modi occupies a uniquely important and powerful position in geopolitics, global trade and finance ‚Äì especially as China‚Äôs growth has slowed. We explain how he got there, and what may come next.\n\nRead more about How Narendra Modi Is Preparing for a Thousand-Year Legacy on Bloomberg: https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-modi-legacy-india-elections/\n\nWhat This $200 Million Temple Says About Modi‚Äôs India: https://youtu.be/Dfxtx1Y0T9E Originally published January 19, 2024\n\nWhen Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurates the new Hindu temple in Ayodhya, many will see it as the capstone of his 10 years in power. Built on the site of a former mosque at a cost estimated at more than $200 million, the temple shows how his Bharatiya Janata Party has become a seemingly unstoppable electoral machine. And the timing of the inauguration, just months before national elections, may boost the election prospects of Modi and his fellow Hindu nationalists. \n\nInside Luxury‚Äôs Secret India Supply Chain: https://youtu.be/Qy2JWUOwTWQ Originally published September 28, 2023\n\nSome of your ‚ÄúMade in France‚Äù luxury items are actually made in India. For decades, fashion houses obscured their business ties to developing nations where labor is cheap, and hard-to-find handicraft skills plentiful.\n\nToday, credit sharing remains contested, even as laws tighten around transparency. We set out to investigate what‚Äôs behind a garment label.\n\nHow India's Drug Exports May Have a Safety Problem: https://youtu.be/3BoQsnqC5zM Originally published December 15, 2023\n\nHospitals around the world use drugs from a small but crucial Indian supplier. In Colombia four kids died and more than a hundred fell ill. In a months-long investigation, Bloomberg Businessweek found that, despite a track record of safety lapses and quality concerns, the manufacturer continued selling its drugs. \n\nRead the full story: http://www.trib.al/NPh1C4F\n\nInside Modi's Dangerous Bet on Alternative Medicine: https://youtu.be/msJOeyHQOoQ Originally published February 28, 2024\n\nIndia‚Äôs alternative medicine industry is booming as ancient principles of healthy living gain new traction, thanks in part to support from Narendra Modi‚Äôs government.  ‚ÄúAyurveda‚Äù, an ancient medical system that has existed in India for centuries, is flourishing with help from holistic-living influencers with vast reach on Instagram and YouTube. But there's a dark side to Ayurveda‚Äôs popularity.\n\nSome doctors in India are seeing patients suffer serious injuries from long term use of ayurvedic medicines. Medical professionals trying to raise awareness about the dangers of alternative medicines have faced lawsuits and even government intervention.\n\nIndia‚Äôs Obesity Time Bomb: https://youtu.be/VLZXmSToMi8 Originally published November 3, 2023\n\nAlmost 1 in 4 adults is considered overweight or obese in India. As junk food giants push into developing nations with weaker public health awareness, campaigners are calling for tougher regulation.\n\n#India #Economy #Documentary \n\nLike this video?

And if you are wondering why politics and economics are important for you as a citizen, I need to tell you that, in our case study of 2022, we presented a case study from the RBI‚Äôs research which clearly alerted everyone about this problem!!

And that was true in 2022!!\n\nBut 2 months ago I saw this linkedin post by Shantanu deshpande who runs a company called the bombay shaving company and he said that they saw a day when they sold more products through blink it than they sold via amazon!! \n\nAnd it is so stunning to know this because, 2 years back blinkit sales were at 0% of amazon for bombay shaving company, a year back it was at 10% of amazon and now blink it sales are crossing 100% of amazon!! And the reason why its a big deal for people like you and me is because, Today if you have your brand was on amazon, it's no big deal because it's too crowded today, but 10 years back, if your brand was on amazon, you had the golden opportunity to achieve insane sales!! And this is where we saw the rise of giant companies like boat, mamaearth and Noise!! So just like amazon 10 years ago, today if you understand why blinkit and instamart are revolutionary, it could be a huge opportunity for you!!\n\nSo as usual, as a business nerd I got deep into every part of the quick commerce industry,  to find out what exactly has fundamentally changed in the quick commerce revolution of India and I found something absolutely mind blowing!!\nSo in this episode today, you are going get a sneak peak into one of the most valuable reports in the history Indian consumer market!!! And this report will tell you, \nHow on earth did a struggling unit like Blinkit start growing faster than zomato?\nhow did quick commerce go from being a landmine to a goldmine in just 2 years??\nWhy does it look like blinkti could beat a giant like amazon in the next 10 years?\nWhat is their business strategy that is making it possible?\nAnd most importantly, what are the business lessons that we need to learn from this blinkit vs amazon case study?\n\nOur Best Indian Business Case Studies:\n1.

        "description": "Compounding is a phenomenon that works wonders over time. It's like a snowball rolling down a hill, gathering more snow and growing larger as it goes. At its core, compounding involves earning returns on both the original investment and the returns that have already been generated. This creates a snowball effect where wealth accumulates exponentially over time.\n\nHere's how it works: let's say you invest Rs. 1000 in a stock or mutual fund that earns an annual return of 10%. In the first year, you earn Rs. 100 in returns, bringing your total investment to Rs. 1100. In the second year, you earn 10% on the entire Rs. 1100, not just the original Rs. 1000. This means you earn Rs. 110 in returns, bringing your total investment to Rs. 1210.\n\nAs the years go by, this process repeats itself, with your investment growing larger and larger with each passing year. The longer you leave your money invested, the more powerful compounding becomes. Over time, even small, regular investments can grow into significant sums.\n\nCompounding is often referred to as the \"eighth wonder of the world\" because of its remarkable ability to grow wealth over time. However, it's important to remember that compounding works best over long periods. It requires patience and discipline to let your investments grow and resist the temptation to withdraw your money prematurely.\n\nBy harnessing the power of compounding and staying invested for the long term, you can build wealth steadily and achieve your financial goals. So start early, invest regularly, and let the power of compounding work its magic for you.\n\nCompounding isn't just about finances; it's a principle applicable to life's many facets. Small, consistent efforts, like daily exercise, can compound into significant improvements in health. Similarly, acts of kindness in relationships build trust over time. Skill-building, with just 15 minutes of practice daily, leads to expertise. This universal principle underscores the power of consistency in achieving incremental gains. So, whether in finances or personal growth, embrace the compounding effect, and watch as steady efforts yield remarkable results across all areas of life.\n\nJoin Learner's Community : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmfl6VteCu880D8Txl4vEag/join\n\nCourses : https://www.financeboosan.in  \n\nWhatsapp Channel : https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va6xVGJ1iUxff71r8p23\nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/finance.boosan/\nOther useful links : https://beacons.ai/boosan\n_______________________________________________\nNew Account opening link  : \nZerodha  :  https://bit.ly/newZerodhaD\n\nVideo Editor : https://www.instagram.com/jagan_editor/\n_______________________________________________\n#financeBoosan #usefulinformationBoosan\nStock Market, Mutual Funds, Investments, Personal Finance, Make Money Online",

        "description": "Choosing the right partition key is crucial to achieving good performance and scalability in DynamoDB. \n\nHi Guys, this is Abi from Gokce DB and in this video, you are going to learn 5 things that you should know before choosing a partition key.\n\n1. A good partition key should have high cardinality, meaning that it should have a large number of distinct values. This ensures that the data is evenly distributed across the partitions, which results in better performance and scalability. Examples include emailid, employee_no, customerid, sessionid & orderid.\n\n2. Choose a partition key that will be frequently queried. The partition key is used to retrieve data from DynamoDB, so it should be chosen based on the most common queries that will be performed. If a partition key is rarely queried, it will result in uneven distribution of data and may lead to hot partitions, which can cause performance issues.\n\n3. Avoid using always increasing values as partition keys such as a timestamps. This can cause all new data to be written to the same partition, resulting in a hot partition. As mentioned earlier, uneven distribution of data can impact the performance of the database.\n\n4. Consider using composite partition keys which means you should try to combine more than one attribute to form a unique key. For example, you could use a combination of customer ID, product ID and country code as a composite partition key if that meets your access pattern.\n\n5. Cache popular items when there is a high volume of read traffic using Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator or DAX.  It is a fully managed, in-memory cache for DynamoDB that will prevent reads of unusually popular items from swamping partitions.\n\nRemember, you cannot change partition key after the table is created. \nBy following these best practices, you can choose a partition key that will optimize performance and scalability in Amazon DynamoDB.",

        "title": "Capacity Planning and Estimation: How much data does YouTube store daily?",
        "description": "Back-of-the-envelope calculations are often expected in system design questions. They help logically state the parameters influencing a result, and estimating the capacity requires multiple estimations on the way. Also lets us individually state our assumptions.\n\nEg: Estimate the hardware requirements to set up a system like YouTube.\nEg: Estimate the number of petrol pumps in the city of Mumbai.\n\nChapters\n00:06 Storage Requirements\n01:20 Supplementary storage requirements\n03:54 Back of Envelope calculations\n05:38 Youtube caching estimation\n08:58 Youtube video processing estimation\n12:14 Conclusion\n\n------STORAGE\nLet's start with storage requirements:\nAbout 1 billion active users.\nI assume 1/1000 produces a video a day.\nWhich means 1 million new videos a day.\n\nWhat's the size of each video?\nAssume the average length of a video to be 10 minutes. \n Assume a 10 minute video to be of size 1 GB. Or...\nA video is a bunch of images. 10 minutes is 600 seconds. Each second has 24 frames. So a video has 25*600 = 150,000 frames.\n Each frame is of size 1 MB. Which means (1.5 * 10^5) * (10^6) bytes = 150 GB.\nThis estimate is very inaccurate, and hence we must either revise our estimate or hope the interviewer corrects us. Normal video of 10 minutes is about 700 MB.\n\nAs each video is of about 1GB, we assume the storage requirement per day is 1GB * 1 million = 1 PB. \n\nThis is the bare minimum storage requirement to store the original videos. If we want to have redundancy for fault tolerance and performance, we have to store copies. I'll choose 3 copies. \nThat's 3 petabytes of raw data storage.\nWhat about video formats and encoding? Let's assume a single type of encoding, mp4, and the formats will take a 720p video and store it in 480, 360, 240 and 144p respectively. That means approximately half the video size per codec.\n\nIf X is the original storage requirement = 1 PB,\nWe have X + X/2 + X/4 + X/8 == 2*X.\nWith redundancy, that's 2X * 3 = 6*X.\n\nThat's 6 PB(processed) + 3PB (raw)  == 10 PB of data. About 100 hard drives. The cost of this system is about 1 million per day.\n\nFor a 3 year plan, we can expect a 1 billion dollar storage price.\n\nNow let's look at the real numbers:\nVideo upload speed = 3 * 10^4 minutes per minute.\nThat's 3 * 10^4 *1440 video footage per day =  4.5 * 10^7 minutes.\nVideo encoding can reduce a 1-hour film to 1 GB. So 1 million GB is the requirement. That's 1 PB.\n\nSo the original cost is similar to what the real numbers say.\n\n\nIf we are off by order of magnitude, it's good. However, being off by 3 or more orders of magnitude is too much. We can then highlight the following:\nWhere our assumption was wrong, or \nWhich factor we didn't take into account. \n\nReferences:\nDesigning Data-Intensive Applications - https://amzn.to/2yQIrxH\nhttp://highscalability.com/youtube-architecture\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5WVu624fY8\nNumbers everyone should know: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=modXC5IWTJI\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-lGCC4KKok\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-of-the-envelope_calculation\nCapacity planning with AWS: https://youtu.be/-3qetLv2Yp0\n\nSystem Design Course: \nhttps://interviewready.io/\n\nAlong with video lectures, this course has architecture diagrams, capacity planning, API contracts and evaluation tests.

The system is designed to run on commodity hardware, making it scalable and fault-tolerant. Google optimized for storing large files, focusing on append operations rather than overwrites. They also emphasized fault detection, fault tolerance, and automated recovery. The system divided files into chunks for parallelism, load balancing, fault tolerance, and easy storage allocation.

        "description": "Norway has had massive success with EV adoption, with 82% of new cars sold in the country last year being electric. This high adoption rate can be attributed to the generous subsidies that Norway has offered to electric vehicle owners as well as the country‚Äôs investment in charging infrastructure. Tesla‚Äôs sales in Norway represent only a sliver of the 1.8 million vehicles the company delivered last year, but Norway‚Äôs importance to Tesla goes beyond cold hard cash. Tesla‚Äôs early foothold in the country has made Norway the perfect proving ground for the company and acted as a poster child for the EV transition as a whole. As a result, Tesla CEO, Elon Musk has taken a number of trips to the small Nordic country and has often praised Norway‚Äôs support of electric vehicles. Norwegians were the first European customers to receive deliveries of the Model S in 2013 and it quickly became the country‚Äôs best-selling car. Today, that title has been transferred over to Tesla‚Äôs Model Y. But with competition from other EV cars from automakers including Toyota, Skoda, Volkswagan and BYD heating up, it remains to be seen if Norwegians will continue to choose Tesla in the future.

        "description": "Yemen's Houthis say they're avenging Gaza. But there's a lot more to it.\n\nHelp keep Vox free for everybody: http://www.vox.com/give-now \n\nAfter the Israel-Hamas war broke out on October 7, 2023, the Houthis, a Yemeni rebel group, began attacking ships passing through the Red Sea. The Houthis pledged to attack any ship in these waters that does business with Israel, to protest Israel‚Äôs war on Gaza and to show solidarity with Palestinians there. But as the attacks have continued, another motive for them has become apparent: strengthening the Houthis‚Äô control of Yemen. \n\nAfter a nine-year civil war, the Houthis today control a sizable area in Yemen, with over 70 percent of the Yemeni population within the group‚Äôs territory. The conflict has devastated the country, creating one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world. More than 377,000 Yemenis have been killed ‚Äî by airstrikes from a Saudi-led coalition; landmines and detonations planted by the Houthis; a lack of medical services; and scarcity of food and water due to a naval blockade. And both the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis have been accused of committing war crimes against Yemenis.\n\nToday, the Houthis are attempting to establish themselves as Yemen's legitimate leaders in the eyes of Yemenis, though they‚Äôve done little to improve the country‚Äôs humanitarian crisis. The Red Sea attacks, which appear to have significant support among the Yemeni people, might be a means to achieve that goal.\n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (üîî) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\n00:00 The Red Sea attacks\n1:09 Saleh and the Zaydis\n3:19 The Arab Spring\n4:24 Civil war\n7:23 Ceasefire talks\n8:23 Legitimacy\n\nSources and further reading:\n\nBack in 2018, we produced a video on how the Saudi-led coalition uses weapons made by the United States to target Yemenis.

It's about having this big-picture vision, inspiring others, and driving real change.\n\nAnd you know what's cool? It's not just about being the boss or having a fancy title. It's about really understanding yourself, your team, and creating an environment where everyone can shine and grow.üíØ\n\nLeaders aren't just people in charge; they're like coaches, cheerleaders, and visionaries rolled into one. They show us that success isn't just about the title (though that‚Äôs awesome too, along with the money) ‚Äì it's about making a meaningful impact and leaving our mark on the world.

        "description": "Stock Market: Strategies, Pitfalls, and Solutions\n\nInvesting in stocks can be thrilling yet challenging. Many investors face hurdles like timing the market, emotional attachments to companies, and neglecting diversification. Let‚Äôs delve into these pitfalls and ways to overcome them.\n\nTiming the Market:\nTrying to predict market movements is risky. Instead, focus on long-term investments. Regular contributions and diversification can help mitigate market volatility.\n\nNot Understanding the Business:\nInvesting without understanding a company‚Äôs fundamentals is akin to gambling. Thorough research is crucial. Analyze the business model, financials, and industry dynamics before investing.\n\nI Love the Company:\nEmotional attachment can cloud judgment. Base investment decisions on objective analysis rather than feelings.\n\nAveraging Down:\nBuying more shares as the stock price drops can be tempting, but it can lead to further losses. Reevaluate the investment thesis before averaging down.\n\nTunnel Vision: My Price, My Portfolio:\nFocusing solely on target prices or allocations can lead to missed opportunities. Stay flexible and adapt to changing market conditions.\n\nLooking Only at Stock Price:\nStock prices may not reflect a company‚Äôs true value. Conduct fundamental analysis to assess a company‚Äôs health and prospects.\n\nPenny Stock Speculation:\nInvesting in penny stocks can be risky due to volatility and speculation. Allocate only a small portion of your portfolio to speculative investments and conduct thorough research.\n\nAllocation Problem:\nProper asset allocation is crucial for managing risk. Diversify across different asset classes and sectors to optimize returns.\n\nWaiting to Get Even: The Biggest Blunder:\nHolding onto losing investments indefinitely can hinder portfolio growth. Cut losses and reallocate funds to better opportunities.\n\nHow to Mitigate:\n\nWhy Are You Even Doing This?: \nAlign your investment strategy with your goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance.\n\nAutomate: Implement automatic investment plans like dollar-cost averaging to maintain discipline.\n\nPlay Part: Stay informed but acknowledge that not every market movement can be predicted. Focus on disciplined, diversified, long-term investing.\n\nIn conclusion, understanding common pitfalls and implementing mitigation strategies can help investors navigate the stock market more effectively, increasing their chances of achieving long-term financial success.\nJoin Learner's Community : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmfl6VteCu880D8Txl4vEag/join\n\nCourses : https://www.financeboosan.in  \n\nWhatsapp Channel : https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va6xVGJ1iUxff71r8p23\nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/finance.boosan/\nOther useful links : https://beacons.ai/boosan\n_______________________________________________\nNew Account opening link  : \nZerodha  :  https://bit.ly/newZerodhaD\n\nVideo Editor : https://www.instagram.com/jagan_editor/\n_______________________________________________\n#financeboosan  #stockmarketindia #investing \nStock Market, Mutual Funds, Investments, Personal Finance, Make Money Online",

        "description": "The Nifty Large Midcap 250 Index offers several advantages over other indices:\n\nBalanced Exposure: It provides a balanced exposure to both large-cap and mid-cap segments, mitigating the risk associated with either segment's performance. This balanced approach ensures that investors benefit from the stability of large-cap stocks while also tapping into the growth potential of mid-cap stocks.\n\nDiversification: By equally allocating investments between large-cap and mid-cap companies, the index fund offers diversification across various companies, sectors, and market capitalizations. This diversification helps spread risk and potentially enhances returns over the long term.\n\nOptimized Allocation: The index fund invests your money equally between the top 100 large companies and the next 150 midcap companies. This allocation strategy is optimized to capture opportunities across both segments of the market, maximizing the potential for returns while minimizing risk.\n\nHistorical Performance: Over various time horizons, the Nifty LargeMidcap 250 Index has demonstrated strong performance relative to other indices such as the Nifty 100 Index and the Nifty Midcap 150 Index. It has outperformed the Nifty 100 Index across multiple long-term periods, indicating its ability to generate superior returns over time.\n\nReturn-Risk Ratio: The index exhibits a higher return-risk ratio compared to the Nifty 100 Index over both short and long-term horizons. This suggests that investors can potentially achieve higher returns for a given level of risk by investing in the Nifty LargeMidcap 250 Index compared to the Nifty 100 Index.\n\nOverall, the Nifty LargeMidcap 250 Index offers investors a well-rounded investment opportunity, combining the stability of large-cap stocks with the growth potential of mid-cap stocks, along with the benefits of diversification and historical performance.\n\nHistorically over a long term this has outperformed Nifty 50 significantly. \n----\nJoin Learner's Community : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmfl6VteCu880D8Txl4vEag/join\n----\nStock Market Courses : https://www.financeboosan.in  \n----\nWhatsapp Channel : https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va6xVGJ1iUxff71r8p23\nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/finance.boosan/\nOther useful links : https://beacons.ai/boosan\n_______________________________________________\nNew Account opening link  : \nZerodha  :  https://bit.ly/newZerodhaD\n\nVideo Editor : https://www.instagram.com/jagan_editor/\n_______________________________________________\n#financeBoosan #usefulinformationBoosan\nStock Market, Mutual Funds, Investments, Personal Finance, Make Money Online",

        "title": "2X your money in 4 years? | Rule of 72",
        "description": "2X your money every 4 years | Rule of 72\nThe Rule of 72 is an easy-to-use formula designed to estimate the time needed for an investment to double its value, given a specific rate of return. This rule is particularly useful with compounded interest rates and tends to be most accurate for rates between 6% and 10%. Beyond investments, the Rule of 72 can also be applied to other areas experiencing exponential growth, such as GDP or inflation rates. It's helpful in understanding the long-term impacts of annual fees on the growth of investments. Additionally, the Rule of 72 can assist in calculating the rate of return necessary for an investment to double within a set time frame. In various circumstances, alternative rules like the Rule of 69, Rule of 70, or Rule of 73 might offer more precision.\n\nHow Do You Calculate the Rule of 72?\nThe Rule of 72 is a straightforward way to estimate how long it will take for an investment to double in value. Simply divide 72 by the investment's expected annual return rate to get the number of years it will approximately take for your investment to double.\n\nFor example, if you have an investment opportunity that promises an 8% annual compounded rate of return, it will take about nine years (72 / 8 = 9) for the investment to double. This means, if you invest ‚Çπ10,000 at this rate, your investment will grow to ‚Çπ20,000 in 9 years, ‚Çπ40,000 in 18 years, ‚Çπ80,000 in 27 years, and so on.\n\nBook 1-1 video call : https://topmate.io/finance_boosan\nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/finance.boosan/\nJoin Learner's Community : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmfl6VteCu880D8Txl4vEag/join\nOther useful links : https://beacons.ai/boosan\n_______________________________________________\nNew Account opening links for leading brokers in India : \nPaytm Money  : https://paytmmoney.onelink.me/9L59/of8ow3sl\nGroww :  https://bit.ly/growwNew\nm.Stock :  https://bit.ly/mstockNew\nZerodha  :  https://bit.ly/newZerodhaD\n\n^ leading brokers in India if you're interested in opening a new broker account.\n(above are my affiliate links)\n_______________________________________________\n#financeBoosan #usefulinformationBoosan\nStock Market, Mutual Funds, Investments, Personal Finance, Make Money Online",

        "description": "Thirty years ago, Taiwan immigrant Jensen Huang founded Nvidia with the dream of revolutionizing PCs and gaming with 3D graphics. In 1999, after laying off the majority of workers and nearly going bankrupt, the company succeeded when it launched what it claims as the world‚Äôs first Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). Then Jensen bet the company on something entirely different: AI. Now, that bet is paying off in a big way as Nvidia‚Äôs A100 chips quickly become the coveted training engines for ChatGPT and other generative AI. But as the chip shortage eases, other chip giants like Intel are struggling. And with all it‚Äôs chips made by TSMC in Taiwan, Nvidia remains vulnerable to mounting U.S.-China trade tensions. We went to Nvidia‚Äôs Silicon Valley, California, headquarters to talk with Huang and get a behind-the scenes-look at the chips powering gaming and the AI boom.\n\nChapters: \n02:04 ‚Äî Chapter 1: Popularizing the GPU\n07:02 ‚Äî Chapter 2: From graphics to AI and ChatGPT\n11:52 ‚Äî Chapter 3: Geopolitics and other concerns\n14:31 ‚Äî Chapter 4: Amazon, autonomous cars and beyond\n\nProduced and shot by: Katie Tarasov\nEdited by: Evan Lee Miller\nAdditional Camera: Andrew Evers\nSupervising Producer: Jeniece Pettitt\nGraphics by: Jason Reginato\n\n¬ª Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n¬ª Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n¬ª Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

        "description": "Learn Basic Of Stock Market Investments | https://www.financeboosan.in\n\n‚ÄéFollow the Finance Boosan channel on WhatsApp: https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va6xVGJ1iUxff71r8p23\n\nDo this before investing\n\n1. Emergency Fund:\n   - Purpose: It serves as a financial safety net in unforeseen circumstances like job loss, medical emergencies, or urgent home repairs.\n   - How much to save: Generally, it's recommended to have enough to cover 3-6 months of living expenses.\n   - Where to keep it: This fund should be easily accessible, ideally in a high-yield savings account or a liquid fund.\n\n2. Term Insurance:\n   - What it is: Term insurance is a type of life insurance that provides coverage at a fixed rate of payments for a limited period. \n   - Importance: It's crucial for those with financial dependents to ensure their family‚Äôs financial security in case of the policyholder's untimely demise.\n\n3. Health Insurance:\n   - Why it's needed: Health insurance covers medical expenses, which can be financially devastating without coverage.\n   - What to consider: Look for a policy with a sufficient cover, considering factors like family health history, coverage for critical illnesses, and network hospitals.\n\n4. Repay Your Debts:\n   - Strategy: Prioritize high-interest debts like credit card balances. Consider debt consolidation or refinancing for better interest rates.\n   - Importance: Reducing debt lowers financial risk and interest expenses, freeing up more money for investments.\n\nNext, consider your investment strategy based on risk appetite, investment goals, and time horizon. Here are major categories to consider:\n\n1. Fixed or Recurring Deposits:\n   - Characteristics: Safe, predictable returns, best for short-term goals.\n   - Consideration: Generally offer lower returns compared to other investment types.\n\n2. Mutual Funds:\n   - Types: Equity-Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS) for tax-saving, Index Funds for passive investing - Active Funds for high risk appetite individuals.\n   - Benefits: Diversification, professional management, suitable for a range of investment goals.\n\n3. Gold:\n   - Options: Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGB), Gold Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), and Gold Mutual Funds.\n   - Role in Portfolio: Acts as a hedge against inflation and market volatility.\n\n4. Bonds:\n   - What they are: Debt instruments where an investor loans money to an entity (corporate or governmental) that borrows the funds for a defined period at a fixed interest rate.\n   - Risk and Return: Generally safer than stocks but with lower potential returns.\n\n5. Real Estate:\n   - Investment in property: Can be for rental income or capital appreciation.\n   - Considerations: Requires significant capital, subject to market risks and liquidity concerns.\n\n6. Direct Stocks:\n   - What it entails: Buying shares of individual companies.\n   - Considerations: High risk and high potential returns, requires market knowledge and active management.\n\n\nAll in one Playlist :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgb4aazT9mz9nDv7OkhW8EabBK0IF9XY2\n\n\nDo this Before investing :\nhttps://youtu.be/POaW7B3J0LI?si=dVVpktN3To8fvn-Z\nhttps://youtu.be/MybInIGu29w?si=GSI6WrooUfmryC6C\nhttps://youtu.be/dY2cXsyvphI?si=HJaud6Ix5L4hiVVP\nhttps://youtu.be/p0RyfYnScZc?si=DiMBWRlzIu-zRPUh\n\nMutual Funds\nhttps://youtu.be/NoN1lkbvVLk?si=SsHIVwJYbm2hZDfe\nhttps://youtu.be/4C_kneqABA8?si=LbBxO3oUnjrpftWK\nhttps://youtu.be/qkBk2V92Ru0?si=TaFx6bldl-_dG0mK\nhttps://youtu.be/lnZJYbmgyfk?si=-L15CcwnG3Ivl0V8\nhttps://youtu.be/h3UDtFnw5as?si=msJc7xFrmhR-UPxl\nhttps://youtu.be/B1TQ6Z0M1ac?si=R_kT91-mGVxHfSzY\n\nGold\nhttps://youtu.be/F4fHYZc-O6E?si=47ZdCn0hgCZ038N0\n\nBonds\nhttps://youtu.be/hxDrKQf8vWE?si=X-8VOUhWzYfG9CrB\n\nStocks\nhttps://youtu.be/ejKlSMrLPJw?si=YwEX3Rn0I3tsPBLN\n\nChapters\n0:00 Intro\n0:11 Why Invest?\n2:01 Do this before investing\n5:46 Which type are you?\n6:32 FD/RD\n7:22 Mutual Funds\n11:15 Gold\n13:15 Bonds\n14:29 Real estate\n16:38 Stocks\n\n----\nJoin Learner's Community : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmfl6VteCu880D8Txl4vEag/join\n----\nStock Market Courses : https://www.financeboosan.in  \n----\nWhatsapp Channel : https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va6xVGJ1iUxff71r8p23\nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/finance.boosan/\nOther useful links : https://beacons.ai/boosan\n_______________________________________________\nNew Account opening links for leading brokers in India : \nPaytm Money  : https://paytmmoney.onelink.me/9L59/of8ow3sl\nGroww :  https://bit.ly/growwNew\nm.Stock :  https://bit.ly/mstockNew\nZerodha  :  https://bit.ly/newZerodhaD\n\n^ leading brokers in India if you're interested in opening a new broker account.\n(above are my affiliate links)\n\nVideo Editor : https://www.instagram.com/jagan_editor/\n_______________________________________________",

        "description": "Learn Basic Of Stock Market Investments at https://www.financeboosan.in \nBuy Term Insurance & Get Online Discount Up to 10%üëáhttp://tinyurl.com/ycy8st2y\n\nBuy Health Insurance & Get up to 25% Discount üëáhttp://tinyurl.com/96cpjr7a\n‚Çπ1 Cr health plan at ‚Çπ390/ month\n\n‚ÄéFollow the Finance Boosan channel on WhatsApp: https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va6xVGJ1iUxff71r8p23\n\n\n3x Monthly Income Rule: Aim to save or invest at least three times your monthly income each year. For instance, if you earn 40K per month, you should have saved or invested 1.2L by year-end. This represents a 25% savings rate, which is slightly below the average savings rate in India (30.2%) but still substantial to start with.\n\n5 Day Rule: Invest or save at least 25% of your income within five days of receiving your paycheck. This can be automated through SIPs (Systematic Investment Plans), RDs (Recurring Deposits), or SSYs (Sukanya Samriddhi Yojanas). For those with irregular income, the key is to invest within five days of receiving the majority of your income.\n\n‚Äú3‚Äù before ‚Äú3‚Äù Rule: Prioritize having an emergency fund, term insurance, and health insurance before investing. An emergency fund should be equivalent to three times your monthly expenses and kept in highly liquid forms like a bank FD or savings account.\n\n40% EMI Debt Repayment Rule: Your EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) or debt payments should not exceed 40% of your total income. If your EMIs are too high, the recommendation is to increase your income to keep the EMI within 40% of your income.\n\n16 EMI Rule: To quickly pay off loans, aim to pay 16 EMIs per year instead of the usual 12. This can significantly reduce the total interest paid and the loan period.\n\n25X Rule: Ensure your term insurance coverage is at least 25 times your annual expenses. This amount of coverage ensures sufficient funds for many years, accounting for inflation and lifestyle maintenance.\n\nRule of 72: This rule helps estimate the time it takes for an investment to double at a given annual rate of return. For example, at a 12% return rate, it would take about 6 years to double the investment.\n\n----\nJoin Learner's Community : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmfl6VteCu880D8Txl4vEag/join\n----\nStock Market Courses : https://www.financeboosan.in  \n----\nWhatsapp Channel : https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va6xVGJ1iUxff71r8p23\nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/finance.boosan/\nOther useful links : https://beacons.ai/boosan\n \n_______________________________________________\n#financeBoosan #usefulinformationBoosan\nStock Market, Mutual Funds, Investments, Personal Finance, Make Money Online\n\n\nLearn Basic Of Stock Market Investments at https://www.financeboosan.in \n\n#healthinsurance #insurance #health #healthcare #financialplanning #covid #healthissues #medicalemergency #medicare #financialfreedom #money #medicalinsurance  #insuranceclaimc #mediclaim #privatehealthinsurance #corporatehealthinsurance #onlinehealthinsurance #onlinehealthpolicy #Medicalcover #Savemedicalbill  #Savemedicalexpenses #freetreatment #policybazaar \n\n\n#lifeinsurance #insurance #financialplanning #financialfreedom #lifeinsuranceagent #investment #money #life #protection #financialliteracy #insurancepolicy #covid #insurancequote #incomeprotection #terminsurance #wealth #financialservices #personalfinance #insurancelife #financialindependence #termInsurance #TermPlan #Termlifeinsurance #OnlineInsurance #BestTermInsurance #Besttermplan #OnlinelifeInsurance #Nocostterminsurance #zerocosttermPlan",

        "description": "The Stuntman becomes the hero. #TheFallGuyMovie only in theaters May 3.\n\n------\n\nHe‚Äôs a stuntman, and like everyone in the stunt community, he gets blown up, shot, crashed, thrown through windows and dropped from the highest of heights, all for our entertainment. And now, fresh off an almost career-ending accident, this working-class hero has to track down a missing movie star, solve a conspiracy and try to win back the love of his life while still doing his day job. What could possibly go right? \n\nFrom real life stunt man and director David Leitch, the blockbuster director of Bullet Train, Deadpool 2, Atomic Blonde and Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw and the producer of John Wick, Nobody and Violent Night, comes his most personal film yet. A new hilarious, hard-driving, all-star apex-action thriller and love letter to action movies and the hard-working and under-appreciated crew of people who make them: The Fall Guy. \n\nOscar¬Æ nominee Ryan Gosling (Barbie, La La Land, Drive) stars as Colt Seavers, a battle-scarred stuntman who, having left the business a year earlier to focus on both his physical and mental health, is drafted back into service when the star of a mega-budget studio movie‚Äîbeing directed by his ex, Jody Moreno, played by Golden Globe winner Emily Blunt (Oppenheimer, A Quiet Place films, Sicario)‚Äîgoes missing.\n\nWhile the film‚Äôs ruthless producer (Emmy winner Hannah Waddingham; Ted Lasso), maneuvers to keep the disappearance of star Tom Ryder (Golden Globe winner Aaron Taylor-Johnson; Bullet Train) a secret from the studio and the media, Colt performs the film‚Äôs most outrageous stunts while trying (with limited success) to charm his way back into Jody‚Äôs good graces. But as the mystery around the missing star deepens, Colt will find himself ensnared in a sinister, criminal plot that will push him to the edge of a fall more dangerous than any stunt.\n\nInspired by the hit 1980s TV series, The Fall Guy also stars Winston Duke (Black Panther franchise) and Academy Award¬Æ nominee Stephanie Hsu (Everything Everywhere All at Once). \n\nFrom a screenplay by Hobbs & Shaw screenwriter Drew Pearce, The Fall Guy is produced by Kelly McCormick (Bullet Train, Nobody, Atomic Blonde) and David Leitch for their company 87North, and by Ryan Gosling and by Guymon Casady (Game of Thrones, Steve Jobs and executive producer of the upcoming series Ripley) for Entertainment 360. The film is executive produced by Drew Pearce, Entertainment 360‚Äôs Geoff Shaevitz and the creator of the original Fall Guy television series, Glen A. Larson.\n\nWebsite: http://www.TheFallGuyMovie.com\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/thefallguymovie \nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/thefallguymovie \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@Universalpics \nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/@UniversalPictures\nX: https://twitter.com/thefallguymovie",

        "description": "PRODUCTIVITY GUILT‚Ä¶‚Å£    #SHORTS\nThat continual nagging feeling that you haven‚Äôt done enough‚Ä¶ That you‚Äôre so far behind‚Ä¶ That you can‚Äôt take a break because you don‚Äôt deserve it‚Ä¶‚Å£\n‚Å£\nSound familiar? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è‚Å£\n‚Å£\nIt‚Äôs quite common among high achievers, and could also a ‚Äòsymptom‚Äô of imposter syndrome and high functioning anxiety.‚Å£\n‚Å£\nIf this is something you experience (It is for me!) here are 3 suggestions that might help;‚Å£\n‚Å£\n1Ô∏è‚É£ Accept You‚Äôll Always Be Imperfect‚Å£\n‚Å£\nPerfection isn‚Äôt the standard you want to be aiming for‚Ä¶ Instead, strive for ‚Äòhuman‚Äô. What does that mean? Well, you can have high standards and strive for excellence, but also know that you‚Äôre only human and only have so much you can fit in your mind (‚Äòcognitive load‚Äô) 7 into your life. And guess what‚Ä¶ mistakes come with the territory!‚Å£\n‚Å£\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Don‚Äôt focus on the Gap between Current Self & Ideal Self‚Å£\n‚Å£\nOne of the reasons why you feel this ‚Äòguilt‚Äô is that you‚Äôre not where you want to be. You have this vision of your ‚Äòideal‚Äô self which is more disciplined, more successful, more of who you want to be‚Ä¶ and you become fixated on the giant gap between this state and where you actually are. Instead of looking at the gap, focus on what you‚Äôre doing each day to take one small step closer to the goal state.‚Å£\n‚Å£\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Prioritize rest‚Å£\n‚Å£\nOne big mistake you might be making if you‚Äôve fallen into the trap of productivity guilt is that you keep pushing to the point of diminishing returns. You‚Äôre no longer ‚Äòproductive‚Äô, but you don‚Äôt stop (‚Äòhello guilt!‚Äô). Yet, if you just took the time to rest, charge your body & replenish your mental battery, get this - you‚Äôd be even MORE productive, getting more done in less time!‚Å£\n‚Å£\nWhat about you? Have you experienced productivity guilt?‚Å£\n---------------\n\nFree training for professional women: https://www.shadezahrai.com/audio-training\n\nTo find out more about Shad√©, visit the website: https://www.shadezahrai.com\n\nFollow her on: \n\n‚Ä¢ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/shadezahrai/\n‚Ä¢ TikTok:¬†¬†https://www.tiktok.com/@shadezahrai\n‚Ä¢ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/shadezahraispeaker\n‚Ä¢ LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/shadezahrai\n\nJoin her private FB group for professional women: https://www.facebook.com/groups/neurofemina/",

But when the plots of Elly‚Äôs fictional books‚Äîwhich center on secret agent Argylle and his mission to unravel a global spy syndicate‚Äîbegin to mirror the covert actions of a real-life spy organization, quiet evenings at home become a thing of the past.\n \nAccompanied by Aiden (Oscar¬Æ winner Sam Rockwell), a cat-allergic spy, Elly (carrying Alfie in her backpack) races across the world to stay one step ahead of the killers as the line between Elly‚Äôs fictional world and her real one begins to blur.\n \nThe top-flight ensemble cast features Henry Cavill (The Witcher), John Cena (Fast X), Oscar¬Æ winner Ariana DeBose (West Side Story), Grammy winning pop superstar Dua Lipa (Barbie), Emmy winner and Oscar¬Æ nominee Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), Emmy winner and comedy icon Catherine O‚ÄôHara (Schitt‚Äôs Creek), Sofia Boutella (Kingsman: The Secret Service), and the legendary Samuel L. Jackson.

The film is produced by Matthew Vaughn, Adam Bohling (Kingsman franchise), Jason Fuchs, and David Reid (Kingsman franchise).

This ensures that each attendee has ample room to relax and fully immerse themselves in the movie without any sense of rush or crowding. The limited number of seats allows for a more intimate and exclusive atmosphere, creating an unforgettable experience.\n\nAs the lights dim, the movie begins, and you're treated to a cinematic journey that harks back to the golden age of film. The state-of-the-art audiovisual technology enhances the scenes, bringing them to life in a way that pays homage to the classics while embracing modern advancements.\n\nOverall, this luxurious theatrical experience offers a perfect blend of nostalgia, opulence, and comfort, allowing you to enjoy movies in a unique and unforgettable way",

        "description": "Gallagher performs hilarious stand-up comedy on The New Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.\n\nThe Smothers Brothers, Tom and Dick, are one of the most iconic comedy duos in the history of television. Tom and Dick began performing as a duo in the late 1950s, playing in coffeehouses and clubs in San Francisco. Their act consisted of music, comedy, and witty banter, which quickly gained them a following.\n\nThe Smothers Brothers became a household name in the late 1960s with their variety show, The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. The show was groundbreaking in its approach to comedy, pushing the boundaries with political satire and social commentary. The show also featured up-and-coming musical acts, including The Doors and The Who, and introduced the world to comedians like Steve Martin and George Carlin.\n\nThe Smothers Brothers' irreverent style has made them a beloved and enduring force in American comedy. \n\nClown Jewels: \nOfficial Website: https://clownjewels.com/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@clownjewels\nFacebook: https://ClownJewels.lnk.to/FacebookID\nTikTok: https://ClownJewels.lnk.to/TikTokID\nInstagram: https://ClownJewels.lnk.to/InstagramID\nTwitter: https://ClownJewels.lnk.to/TwitterID\n\n800 Pound Gorilla: \nOfficial Website: https://800poundgorillamedia.com/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@800pgm\nFacebook: https://800PGR.lnk.to/FacebookID\nTikTok: https://800PGR.lnk.to/TikTokID\nInstagram: https://800PGR.lnk.to/InstagramID\nTwitter: https://800PGR.lnk.to/TwitterID\n\n#smothersbrothers #Gallagher, #standup",

        "description": "Not all races can be won. #FASTX \nGet tickets now: https://tickets.fastxmovie.com/\n\nOfficial Motion Picture Soundtrack Pre-Save: https://fastx.lnk.to/soundtrack!Trailer\nGasolina Remix: https://fastx.lnk.to/GasolinaRemix!FastX\n\nThe end of the road begins. \n\nFast X, the tenth film in the Fast & Furious Saga, launches the final chapters of one of cinema‚Äôs most storied and popular global franchises, now in its third decade and still going strong with the same core cast and characters as when it began.\n\nOver many missions and against impossible odds, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family have outsmarted, out-nerved and outdriven every foe in their path. Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they‚Äôve ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who‚Äôs fueled by blood revenge, and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything‚Äîand everyone‚Äîthat Dom loves, forever.  \n \nIn 2011‚Äôs Fast Five, Dom and his crew took out nefarious Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes and decapitated his empire on a bridge in Rio De Janeiro. What they didn‚Äôt know was that Reyes‚Äô son, Dante (Aquaman‚Äôs Jason Momoa), witnessed it all and has spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price. \n \nDante‚Äôs plot will scatter Dom‚Äôs family from Los Angeles to the catacombs of Rome, from Brazil to London and from Portugal to Antarctica. New allies will be forged and old enemies will resurface. But everything changes when Dom discovers that his own 8-year-old son (Leo Abelo Perry, Black-ish) is the ultimate target of Dante‚Äôs vengeance. \n \nDirected by Louis Leterrier (Clash of the Titans, The Incredible Hulk), Fast X stars returning cast members Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris ‚ÄúLudacris‚Äù Bridges, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Jason Statham, John Cena and Scott Eastwood, with Oscar¬Æ winner Helen Mirren and Oscar¬Æ winner Charlize Theron. \n \nThe film also features an extraordinary new cast including Oscar¬Æ winner Brie Larson as Tess, a rogue representative from the Agency; Alan Richtson (Reacher) as Aimes, the new head of the Agency who doesn‚Äôt hold the same fondness for Dom‚Äôs crew as his predecessor, Mr. Nobody; Daniela Melchior (The Suicide Squad) as a Brazilian street racer with a powerful tie to Dom‚Äôs past; and legendary Oscar¬Æ winner Rita Moreno as Dom and Mia‚Äôs Abuelita Toretto. \n \nFast X is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Justin Lin, Jeff Kirschenbaum and Samantha Vincent. The executive producers are Joseph M. Caracciolo, Jr., David Cain, Chris Morgan, Amanda Lewis and Mark Bomback. www.thefastsaga.com\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.fastxmovie.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheFastSaga\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/TheFastSaga\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheFastSaga\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thefastsaga",

        "description": "The Suzuki Baleno is one of the go-to hatchbacks for our Indian consumer because of its amazing fuel efficiency, spacious interiors and because it's easy to maintain. But, Suzuki had come out with a performance oriented version of the Baleno called the Baleno RS and it sported the 1.0L Turbo 3-Cylinder engine called the Booster Jet! This was the first car to get such an engine and in fact, VW's Polo 1.0 TSI and the Hyundai i20 N-Line have actually followed the Baleno RS' footsteps. Want to know why you should buy the Baleno RS, watch the whole video to find out!",

        "description": "On June 16, worlds collide. Watch the official trailer now for The Flash ‚Äì only in theaters. #TheFlashMovie \n\nWarner Bros. Pictures presents ‚ÄúThe Flash,‚Äù directed by Andy Muschietti (the ‚ÄúIT‚Äù films, ‚ÄúMama‚Äù). Ezra Miller reprises their role as Barry Allen in the DC Super Hero‚Äôs first-ever standalone feature film.\n\nWorlds collide in ‚ÄúThe Flash‚Äù when Barry uses his superpowers to travel back in time in order to change the events of the past. But when his attempt to save his family inadvertently alters the future, Barry becomes trapped in a reality in which General Zod has returned, threatening annihilation, and there are no Super Heroes to turn to. That is, unless Barry can coax a very different Batman out of retirement and rescue an imprisoned Kryptonian‚Ä¶ albeit not the one he‚Äôs looking for. Ultimately, to save the world that he is in and return to the future that he knows, Barry‚Äôs only hope is to race for his life. But will making the ultimate sacrifice be enough to reset the universe? \n\n‚ÄúThe Flash‚Äù ensemble also includes rising star Sasha Calle, Michael Shannon (‚ÄúBullet Train,‚Äù ‚ÄúBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice‚Äù), Ron Livingston (‚ÄúLoudermilk,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Conjuring‚Äù), Maribel Verd√∫ (‚ÄúElite,‚Äù ‚ÄúY tu mam√° tambi√©n‚Äù), Kiersey Clemons (‚ÄúZack Snyder‚Äôs Justice League,‚Äù ‚ÄúSweetheart‚Äù), Antje Traue (‚ÄúKing of Ravens,‚Äù ‚ÄúMan of Steel‚Äù) and Michael Keaton (‚ÄúSpider-Man: Homecoming,‚Äù ‚ÄúBatman‚Äù).\n\n‚ÄúThe Flash‚Äù is produced by Barbara Muschietti (the ‚ÄúIT‚Äù films, ‚ÄúMama‚Äù) and Michael Disco (‚ÄúRampage,‚Äù ‚ÄúSan Andreas‚Äù).

The executive producers \nare Toby Emmerich, Walter Hamada, Galen Vaisman and Marianne Jenkins.\n\nJoining director Muschietti behind the camera are director of photography Henry Braham (‚ÄúGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Suicide Squad‚Äù), production designer Paul Denham Austerberry (‚ÄúIT Chapter Two,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Shape of Water‚Äù), editors Jason Ballantine (the ‚ÄúIT‚Äù films, ‚ÄúThe Great Gatsby‚Äù) and Paul Machliss (‚ÄúThe Gentlemen,‚Äù ‚ÄúBaby Driver‚Äù), and costume designer Alexandra Byrne (‚ÄúDoctor Strange,‚Äù ‚ÄúGuardians of the Galaxy‚Äù); the score is by Benjamin Wallfisch \n(‚ÄúThe Invisible Man,‚Äù the ‚ÄúIT‚Äù films).\n\nWarner Bros.

They were inseparable.\n\nIn the years that passed, Bikram and Bala, became Calcutta's most loved, most celebrated, most reckless, most fearless and most powerful GUNDAY!\n\nThey had everything... then, one fine day, bells rang...\n\nNandita, the most beautiful cabaret dancer, walked into their lives, and they lost everything to her. Their murky world turned magical and colourful. They fell head over heels in love with her.\n\nBut that was only a blissful lull before an impending storm...\n\nAnd then entered ACP Satyajeet Sarkar, the right for every wrong, a law for every outlaw and a counter force for Bikram and Bala.\n\nWhat follows from here is the most sensational-most thrilling-most dramatic story ever told!\n\n#YRFnewreleases #Gunday #YRF #RanveerSingh #ArjunKapoor #PriyankaChopra #IrrfanKhan #AliAbbasZafar #SohailSen #IrshadKamil #VishalDadlani #KK #NeetiMohan #BappiLahiri\n\n¬© Yash Raj Films Pvt.

Vinnaithaandi Varuvaayaa also known as VTV is in theatres for more than 14 years. Many call it Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge or DDLJ of South India. Starring Shahrukh Khan & Kajol ‚Äì DDLJ is running in theatres since 1995. VTV is proving to be DDLJ of ARR.

But its Hindi remake Ekk Deewana Tha flopped. Why? Director Gautham Vasudev Menon explains.

Guangzhou has a total of four autonomous bus routes, and the one I'm taking you on today is a route that doesn't require any tickets or reservations. This self-driving bus has many advantages, such as being smooth, having a good view, and being very comfortable to ride. It's a great experience for those who get carsick.\n\nI'll also take you on a tour of a route that runs through the city center. This route has a steering wheel and a safety driver, and it requires advance reservations, so it's a bit more complicated.\n\nFinally, we'll visit a building on Guangzhou's Yuejiang West Road, which is a new business center that Guangzhou is focusing on developing. Many large companies will have offices here. This area also has an autonomous bus route.\n\n00:00 -- Start\n00:35 -- Riding the driverless bus (Shengwu Dao Diecuiyuan Station)\n01:26 -- Experience of riding the driverless bus\n03:48 -- Driverless bus route 2 (Canton Tower Station)\n04:50 -- Driverless bus visualization dashboard\n07:10 -- Yuejiang West Road headquarters building\n09:59 -- Business center in the building.",

DeepSeek, as the lab is called, unveiled a free, open-source large-language model in late December that it says took only two months and less than $6 million to build.  The new developments have raised alarms on whether America‚Äôs global lead in artificial intelligence is shrinking and called into question big tech‚Äôs massive spend on building AI models and data centers. In a set of third-party benchmark tests, DeepSeek‚Äôs model outperformed Meta‚Äôs Llama 3.1, OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o and Anthropic‚Äôs Claude Sonnet 3.5 in accuracy ranging from complex problem-solving to math and coding.

The answer lies in how the Earth is divided into 24 time zones! ‚è∞ Because time moves from east to west, the first country to welcome the New Year is Kiribati üéâ an island nation located near the International Date Line. Its time zone is so unique, it even stretches the rules of geography! Meanwhile, the last place to ring in the New Year is American Samoa. üï∞Ô∏è These islands are surprisingly close to Kiribati but sit on the opposite side of the Date Line, creating an astonishing 25-hour time difference! üåê‚ú®\n\n\n#newyear #timezone #weirdborders #time #utc #worldclock #greenwich #timezones #kiribati #americansamoa #internationaldateline #usa #unitedstates #states #learn #map #maps #geography #history #viralfact #facts #fyp #interestingplace #geoshorts #historyshorts #shorts #uniquegeography #learning #viral #viralmap #maplovers #geographyeducation #geographygeeks #geographystory",

She speaks with remarkable honesty about finding unconditional love after believing she never would, making the first move in her relationship, and the importance of speaking up against unfair practices.

        "description": "In recent years, the cost of cars in India has been steadily rising, creating significant challenges for the middle class. What was once considered a luxury item has now become a near-essential mode of transportation, yet the affordability gap continues to widen. The increasing car prices can be attributed to several complex factors that impact the overall cost structure.\n\nTaxation plays a crucial role in determining car prices in India. The government levies multiple taxes, including Goods and Services Tax (GST), road tax, registration charges, and additional state-specific levies. These taxes can add substantial amounts to the base price of a vehicle. For instance, the GST rates vary between 5% and 28% depending on the type and value of the car, significantly inflating the final price.\nManufacturing costs have also risen due to several factors. \n\nThe implementation of stricter safety and emission norms requires manufacturers to invest in advanced technologies and more sophisticated manufacturing processes. Additionally, raw material costs, including steel, aluminum, and electronic components, have increased globally. The transition towards electric and hybrid vehicles has further pushed up development and production expenses.\n\nImport duties on crucial components and the need for localization add another layer of complexity to pricing. While the government encourages domestic manufacturing through initiatives like Make in India, the automotive supply chain still faces challenges that contribute to higher costs.\n\nThe result is a challenging landscape for middle-class consumers, who find themselves stretching their budgets to own a vehicle that has become increasingly necessary for daily life in India's rapidly developing urban and suburban environments.",

        "description": "Join Learner's Community : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmfl6VteCu880D8Txl4vEag/join\nOfficial Website - Courses & Learning Materials : https://www.financeboosan.in  \n\nClubbing of Income Under Indian Tax Laws\nClubbing of Income refers to the inclusion of another person's income in the taxpayer's total income for tax computation purposes. This concept is aimed at preventing tax evasion by taxpayers who might otherwise transfer their income or assets to others, typically family members, to reduce their tax liability.\n\nThe provisions governing clubbing of income are outlined in Sections 60 to 64 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Here‚Äôs an overview:\n\n1. Transfer of Income without Transfer of Assets (Section 60)\nIf a person transfers income from an asset to another person without transferring the ownership of the asset, the income from such an asset is taxed in the hands of the transferor.\nExample: If Mr. A owns a property and transfers the rental income to his spouse without transferring the property itself, the rental income will still be taxed in Mr. A's hands.\n\n2. Revocable Transfer of Assets (Section 61)\nIf a person transfers an asset under a revocable arrangement, the income from such an asset will be taxed in the hands of the transferor.\nA revocable transfer is one where the transferor retains the right to reclaim the asset or income.\nExample: Mr. A transfers a property to his son but retains the right to revoke the transfer. In such a case, the income from the property is taxed in Mr. A's hands.\n\n3. Income of Spouse (Section 64(1)(ii))\nIf an individual‚Äôs spouse earns income from an entity where the individual has substantial interest, and the spouse does not possess technical or professional qualifications, the income is clubbed with the income of the individual.\nSubstantial interest typically means holding at least 20% of the equity shares or profits in the entity.\nExample: Mrs. A works in a company where Mr. A has a 30% shareholding. If Mrs. A has no technical or professional qualification for the job, her salary will be clubbed with Mr. A‚Äôs income.\n\n4. Income from Assets Transferred to Spouse (Section 64(1)(iv))\nIncome from assets transferred directly or indirectly to the spouse without adequate consideration is clubbed with the income of the transferor, except where the asset is transferred under an agreement to live apart.\nExample: If Mr. A gifts a house to Mrs. A, the rental income from the house will be taxed in Mr. A‚Äôs hands.\n\n5. Income from Assets Transferred to Son‚Äôs Wife (Section 64(1)(vi))\nIf an individual transfers assets to their son's wife without adequate consideration, the income from such assets is clubbed with the income of the transferor.\nExample: Mr. A gifts shares to his daughter-in-law. The dividend income from these shares will be taxed in Mr. A‚Äôs hands.\n\n6. Income of Minor Child (Section 64(1A))\nThe income of a minor child is clubbed with the income of the parent whose total income (excluding the child‚Äôs income) is greater.\nThere are certain exceptions where the child‚Äôs income is not clubbed, such as income earned by a minor from manual work, or from an activity involving the minor‚Äôs talent, or income of a minor child suffering from a disability as specified under Section 80U.\nThe parent can claim an exemption of up to ‚Çπ1,500 per child per year on the income that is clubbed.\n\n7. Implications of Clubbing of Income\nClubbing can lead to a higher tax liability since the income is added to the transferor‚Äôs total income.\nThe clubbed income is taxed at the transferor's applicable slab rate, which might be higher than that of the recipient.\n\n8. Prevention of Misuse\nThe provisions are designed to prevent misuse, such as transferring assets or income to relatives in lower tax brackets to reduce the overall tax burden.\nThe tax authorities are vigilant in ensuring that these rules are not circumvented through artificial transactions.\n\nConclusion\nThe concept of clubbing of income plays a significant role in ensuring that tax liabilities are not reduced unfairly through the transfer of assets or income. It is important for taxpayers to understand these provisions to comply with tax laws and avoid penalties or additional taxes. Proper tax planning and consultation with a tax professional can help manage these aspects effectively.\n\n(Courtesy ChatGPT)\n\nCan you save tax by transferring to Wife's account?\n\nSocial Media\nWhatsapp Channel : https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va6xVGJ1iUxff71r8p23\nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/finance.boosan/\n\nNew Account opening link for SIP and Stock Investments  : \nZerodha  :  https://bit.ly/newZerodhaD\n\nVideo Editor : https://www.instagram.com/jagan_editor/\n\n\n#financeBoosan #personalfinance \nStock Market, Mutual Funds, Investments, Personal Finance, Make Money Online",

        "description": "Mid-cap and small-cap funds are among the most sought-after mutual funds. However, their high volatility is a problem. In this video, we find out if multi-cap funds can be a better way to invest in mid and small caps. \n\nMulti-cap funds are required to invest at least 25% of their assets each in large, mid and small caps. So, at any point, they have 50% assets invested in mid and small caps. Their large-cap exposure helps provide the required stability. So, multi-cap funds can be both rewarding and less volatile.\n\nFew other diversified categories provide this return mix. For example, flexi-cap funds tend to be large-cap heavy and large & mid-cap funds tend to be underweight in small caps. So, multi-cap funds are in a distinguished position.\n\nBut the analysis of multi-cap funds is not easy as they came into being only in 2021. They have an interesting history that you can learn more about in the video. So, to analyse these funds, we had to create a multi-cap fund. We did so by taking the Nifty 100, Nifty Midcap 150 and Nifty Smallcap 250 total-return indices and then allocating assets to them as per the asset allocation of multi-cap funds over the last 2 years. We also rebalanced the resulting proxy multi-cap fund on a yearly basis.\n\nWe then compared the performance of this proxy multi-cap fund with the mid-cap and small-cap indices. The comparison revealed that not only did the proxy multi-cap fund do considerably well on the returns front but it also offered less volatility and better downside protection. \n\nThough the study had its limitations, it can be concluded that multi-cap funds can be a good way to invest in mid and small caps. Plus, they can also take care of asset allocation across market caps.\n\n#ETMoney\n\nüëâ To invest in Direct Plans of top Mutual Funds for free, download the ET Money app: https://etmoney.onelink.me/unJQ/5ca1ae3b \n\nüëâ Subscribe to ET Money Hindi\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzWtyDo9KmEC1JoAqa1LIEw\n\nüëâ Read more such informative articles at https://www.etmoney.com/blog\n\nüëâ Follow us on: \n‚ñ∫ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ETMONEY/ \n‚ñ∫ Twitter: https://twitter.com/etmoney \n‚ñ∫ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/etmoney_official/\n‚ñ∫ LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/et_money/",

        "description": "For the first time in more than two decades Mexico overtook China as the largest importer of goods to the U.S.\n\nMexican goods imported to the U.S. totaled $475 billion in 2023 about $20 billion higher than the previous year. Feuling that trend are simmering trade tensions between Beijing and Washington, an effort to bring U.S. imports closer to home and a burgeoning Mexican manufacturing base. But there‚Äôs another factor at play. To avoid American tariffs Chinese companies are using Mexico as a backdoor to the U.S. So how is China able to circumvent U.S. tariffs and what are logistic companies doing to prepare for the upcoming boom in Mexican trade.

        "description": "Subscribe for more: https://www.youtube.com/@remoterish?sub_confirmation=1\n\nIn this video, I challenge the popular concept of forever buying and holding mutual funds. \n\nWhile many investors follow this advice, I believe it's unrealistic. \n\nEvery year, you see a new list of top mutual funds across large-cap, mid-cap, flexi-cap, and more. If the list keeps changing, how can anyone expect to buy and hold a fund forever?\n\nI explain why mutual funds constantly evolve, with fund managers changing, strategies shifting, and market cycles turning. \n\nOver time, these factors can dramatically affect your returns. In contrast, index funds provide a much more stable option for long-term investing. \n\nWith index funds, the role of the fund manager is minimal, and the portfolio simply tracks the top companies in the market, making them more reliable for holding over the long term. \n\nThere's no need to worry about constant shifts in performance or new funds entering the spotlight every year.\n\nI explore why index funds are easier to hold forever, how they minimize the emotional and strategic noise that comes from market speculation, and why this approach works better for long-term wealth building. \n\nI also touch on why it's crucial to avoid being swayed by flashy marketing from mutual funds, which often promise high returns but require constant attention and changes to your strategy.\n\nIf you're someone who's aiming to build a long-term portfolio with minimal intervention and wants to stay focused on the core principles of compounding, this video will give you a practical guide on how to achieve that through index investing.\n\nKey Takeaways:\nThe myth of holding mutual funds forever.\nHow index funds offer simplicity and stability.\nWhy market noise from fund managers can disrupt long-term plans.\nThe power of sticking with funds that change the least.\n\n‚Äî\nLinks:\nüíº Connect on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/rishabhdev/\nüì∏ Follow on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/remoterish/\nüåü Join on X: https://x.com/reachrishabh\n\nüöÄ Join my WhatsApp Community: https://bit.ly/freedom-investing\nüì© Sign up for my Newsletter: https://bit.ly/rishabh-dev-newsletter\n\nüîî Turn on notifications to stay updated with new uploads",

        "description": "A lot of smart investors use the SIP-plus-lump sum strategy for better returns. They maintain an ongoing SIP in mutual funds, and when markets fall, they invest a lump sum amount to benefit from market corrections. Recently, on 4th June, we saw markets fall close to 6% following unexpected election results. On that day, many investors seized the opportunity to invest lump sums, aiming to capitalize on the correction.\n\nBut does this strategy work? In this video, we dive deep into the data to find surprising answers. We'll explore three key aspects: the type of correction (whether to invest when markets fall or when valuations are low), the size of the correction (ideal investment points at 5%, 10%, or 15% drops), and the optimal investment horizon to maximize returns with this strategy. Watch the video to discover which combination of variables produces the highest returns and how you can optimize your investment strategy.\n\nChapters\n00:00 Introduction\n02:00 Key assumptions taken for the analysis\n04:28 Buying on dips - easy way to earn more returns?\n\n#ETMoney\n\nüëâ To invest in Direct Plans of top Mutual Funds for free, download the ET Money app: https://etmoney.onelink.me/unJQ/5ca1ae3b \n\nüëâ Subscribe to ET Money Hindi\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzWtyDo9KmEC1JoAqa1LIEw\n\nüëâ 5 Minute Finance channel\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@5-Minute-Finance\n\nüëâ Learn about Investments, Tax-Saving and Future Planning  https://www.etmoney.com/learn\n\nüëâ Follow us on: \n‚ñ∫ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ETMONEY/ \n‚ñ∫ Twitter: https://twitter.com/etmoney \n‚ñ∫ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/etmoney_official/\n‚ñ∫ LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/et_money/\n‚ñ∫ Whatsapp: https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VaB4nh0HltY56g6cA81b",

        "title": "How Amazon Failed to Understand India? - Business Case Study",
        "description": "00:00 - Intro\n02:00 - Arrival in India\n03:21 - Strategy in India\n06:16 - How is it Failing?\n12:05 - Future of Amazon\n\nAmazon's journey in India has been marked by both promise and challenges. In 2015, Jeff Bezos declared India as Amazon‚Äôs most crucial market after the US. India, with its rapid economic growth and emerging e-commerce landscape, appeared to be a perfect opportunity for Amazon to extend its global dominance. Initially, Amazon invested heavily, pouring over $5 billion into its operations, and significantly shaping the country‚Äôs e-commerce sector alongside Flipkart. Amazon's infrastructure, customer experience, and seller services helped the company gain a strong foothold, especially in tier-1 cities, positioning it as a major player in India's e-commerce landscape.\n\nHowever, in recent years, Amazon's growth in India has slowed, and it is facing significant competition from newer players like Meesho, Zepto, and Blinkit. In FY-23, Amazon India‚Äôs revenue grew by only 3.4%, the slowest growth in its history. One of the primary reasons for this slowdown is the shift in India‚Äôs e-commerce landscape. India is not a homogenous market but is divided into different segments based on income and consumption patterns, often referred to as India 1, India 2, and India 3. Amazon initially targeted the premium segment, India 1, which accounted for a small portion of the population but the majority of the country's consumption. However, by 2017, this segment started reaching saturation, and the growth in e-commerce began shifting towards tier-2 and tier-3 cities (India 2 and 3), which have different needs and behaviors.\n\nThe arrival of Reliance Jio and the subsequent rise of internet penetration brought millions of new consumers from smaller towns online. These consumers, however, were more price-sensitive and less familiar with online shopping, and Amazon failed to adapt quickly to their needs. Meesho capitalized on this gap by introducing innovative solutions, such as selling through WhatsApp groups and enabling local resellers, which built trust and made online shopping accessible for this new wave of customers. Meesho‚Äôs zero-commission model and faster payment cycles for sellers also gave it a competitive advantage, especially among smaller sellers.\n\nAnother challenge for Amazon is the rise of quick commerce in India. Post-pandemic, companies like Blinkit revolutionized the market by offering 10-minute grocery and product deliveries. This sector, which didn‚Äôt exist a few years ago, is growing at an explosive rate, with Blinkit already being valued at $13 billion‚Äîhalf of Amazon India's valuation. While Amazon has always prided itself on fast delivery, it has yet to make significant moves into the quick commerce space, leaving it vulnerable to competitors.\n\nFurthermore, government regulations have added to Amazon's difficulties. India‚Äôs regulatory environment is increasingly cautious of foreign dominance in crucial sectors like e-commerce. In 2019, new rules prevented companies like Amazon from selling products from brands in which they held a stake, forcing Amazon to remove hundreds of thousands of products from its platform. The Indian government‚Äôs push for a more open and competitive e-commerce sector, through initiatives like ONDC, also threatens Amazon's future in the country.\n\nIn response to these challenges, Amazon is now shifting focus to other sectors, such as cloud computing and digital payments. However, Amazon‚Äôs core e-commerce business remains essential to its overall strategy, as it serves as the distribution network for its other ventures. If the company cannot regain its momentum in e-commerce, its ability to expand into new areas may also be hampered. Despite the setbacks, the future of Amazon in India remains uncertain, and it will need to rethink its approach to compete in this rapidly changing market.\n\nConnect with us:\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bwmillionaires/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/backstagewithmillionaires/\nPodcast: https://open.spotify.com/show/5rGPalovc6AKsfbOyjh32p\n\n#amazon #zomato #jeffbezos #zepto #blinkit",

        "description": "The video discusses the challenges faced by drivers working for cab-hailing services like Ola and Uber in India, particularly regarding commissions and delayed payments. It talks about a new business model introduced by Namma Yatri, a part of the government-led ONDC, aimed at addressing these issues. This model eliminates commissions and instead charges drivers a fixed subscription fee, offering them more control over their earnings and immediate payment from customers. Since its launch, this model has gained significant traction, with over 3 lakh drivers joining Namma Yatri, leading to its expansion into other cities.\n\nThe success of Namma Yatri's zero-commission model has put pressure on traditional players like Ola and Uber to adopt similar strategies. Rapido, another cab-hailing service, was the first to adopt this model, prompting Ola and Uber to follow suit to avoid losing drivers to competitors. This shift signifies a significant disruption in the cab-hailing industry, challenging the dominance of Ola and Uber and potentially reshaping the market dynamics.\n\nFurthermore, Namma Yatri has announced plans to enter the cab-hailing business in Bengaluru, further intensifying competition in the sector. This move poses a significant threat to Ola and Uber, which have established themselves over the years. Ola, in particular, is gearing up for an IPO, adding more pressure on the company to adapt to changing market trends.\n\nConnect with us:\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/bwmillionaires/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/backstagewithmillionaires/\nPodcast: https://open.spotify.com/show/5rGPalovc6AKsfbOyjh32p\n\n#nammayatri #startup #entrepreneur",

That money is now worth 3.7 Billion dollars, a staggering 217x return on investment. \n\nSanjeev‚Äôs other successful bet was in PolicyBazaar, a company he has backed since 2007. His investment in the company of 69 Million dollars, is now worth 1.02 Billion dollars. \n\nBut the question is, how did he achieve this?\n\nIn one word, the answer is ‚Äòpatience‚Äô. See, a typical VC firm has a fund cycle of 10 years, which means they have to exit before that. \n\nBut the Indian market takes longer periods to give big returns, almost 15 years in these two cases.\n\nAnd because of this reason, other VC firms like Sequoia and Softbank exited Zomato soon after its IPO and couldn‚Äôt make big returns.",

Compared to other LLM frameworks, it offers these core benefits: cycles, controllability, and persistence. LangGraph allows you to define flows that involve cycles, essential for most agentic architectures, differentiating it from DAG-based solutions. As a very low-level framework, it provides fine-grained control over both the flow and state of your application, crucial for creating reliable agents. Additionally, LangGraph includes built-in persistence, enabling advanced human-in-the-loop and memory features.\nCode Link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1S9Hvp6XrJ_Jy_vWt1MBXKnOvfxS9Z4oE?usp=sharing\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCheck out my Udemy Course\nData Analyst Bootcamp:https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-data-analyst-bootcamp-from-basics-to-advanced/?couponCode=EDB0ADCCE272C2190C14\n\nMathematics Basics to Advanced for Data Science \n\nhttps://www.udemy.com/course/mathematics-basics-to-advanced-for-data-science-and-ml/?couponCode=D3ED31D3AE79D1CCEF99\n\nComplete Maching Learning, NLP Bootcamp With Deployment :https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-machine-learning-nlp-bootcamp-mlops-deployment/?couponCode=70D09C7863B20DA2E9E3\n\n\nComplete Generative AI with Langchain and Huggignface : https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-generative-ai-course-with-langchain-and-huggingface/?couponCode=34430E70BDA0494ECC21\n\nBuilding GenAI apps 12+ end to end projects :https://www.udemy.com/course/building-gen-ai-app-end-to-end-projects-with-gemini-pro/?couponCode=915C77B734393B72C80E\n\n\nMastering Figma from 0 to 100 : https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-figma-from-0-to-100/?couponCode=ED932A4592EBACB50D17",

Most of those twisters are touching down in the central part of the country in an area called ‚ÄúTornado Alley.‚Äù While the boundaries of this tornado hotbed are disputed, there‚Äôs no denying that something is going on here ‚Äî and it all has to do with geography. \n\nThe map we use in this video for Tornado Alley boundaries is from NOAA ‚Äî you can find that and more information on their website: https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/climate-information/extreme-events/us-tornado-climatology/tornado-alley\n\nInformation on tornado averages and trends can also be found at NOAA:\nhttps://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/climate-information/extreme-events/us-tornado-climatology/trends\n\nYou may have noticed on our graphic around the one-minute mark that many of the Southeastern US states are prone to tornadoes as well. This is because they‚Äôre part of an area called ‚ÄúDixie Alley.‚Äù The main difference between this area and Tornado Alley that tornadoes in Dixie Alley are more likely to touch down in the fall, while Tornado Alley experiences twisters in the early spring. This happens for the reasons outlined in the video above. This article offers a fairly compelling comparison of the two: \nhttp://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.660.5241&rep=rep1&type=pdf\n\nFinally, this video offered a simplified explanation of a really complex weather phenomenon. This National Geographic article does a really great job breaking it down again and also offers information on why it‚Äôs so hard to track and predict tornadoes:\nhttps://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/05/150511-tornadoes-storms-midwest-weather-science/\n\nSubscribe to our channel! http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\nVox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.

Directed by Lee Isaac Chung, the Oscar¬Æ nominated writer-director of Minari, Twisters stars Daisy Edgar-Jones (Where the Crawdads Sing), Glen Powell (Top Gun: Maverick) and Anthony Ramos (Transformers: Rise of the Beasts) as equal forces, with opposing motivations, who come together to try to predict, and possibly tame, the immense power of tornadoes.\n\nEdgar-Jones stars as Kate Carter, a former storm chaser haunted by a devastating encounter with a tornado during her college years who now studies storm patterns on screens safely in New York City. She is lured back to the open plains by her friend, Javi (Ramos) to test a groundbreaking new tracking system.

        "description": "üá∫üá∏America-‡Æ≤ ‚ö°Ô∏èüîãüîåElectricity Crisis. Old Power Grid. Damaged Hook. Wild Fire. Texas Power Crisis. \n\nüá∫üá∏ Energy Crisis of USA\nSomeone said there is no power cut in the USA üá∫üá∏ What a joke. \nUSA's Power Grid is so old. A 98-year-old hook had caused a wildfire. \nUtility companies like P&GE are going bankrupt trying to fix their equipment. \nThe whole country is struggling to meet the energy requirements. \nWith more electric cars on the road, people are putting extreme loads on the power grid. \n\nüá∫üá∏ Timed Meter!\nIn Bay Area, California where I live. I charge my car only during the night. Because electricity is very very expensive during day time! \nYes, there is a timed meter at my home. \nI have programmed to charge my Tesla only after 12midnight.\nI will plug it in during the day, but it will start charging only after 12 midnight. \n\nüáÆüá≥In India, where the new powerlines are laid under the ground. \nüá∫üá∏But in the USA, so many homes have overhead power cables. \n\nüá∫üá∏Long Ago\nSince the USA started creating electricity lines so long ago. They did not think through a good solution. They laid miles and miles of overhead power lines, which is susceptible to extreme weather conditions. \n\nüá∫üá∏Climate Change\nWith increasing extreme weather conditions all around the USA, the cables are falling down. \n\nüá∫üá∏Labor\nFurthermore,  Labor is very expensive in the USA. Government and Utility contractors could not finish their jobs on time due to a lack of skilled labor. \n\nüá∫üá∏Immigration:\nThe country's leaders are refusing to make a comprehensive immigration change. This condition is only going to get worse. The USA lacks the know-how, skills, and physical labor to fix the infrastructure. \n\nThis is my opinion only. Please do your own research. \n\n- Hobby Explorer \n\nüá∫üá∏‡ÆÖ‡ÆÆ‡ØÜ‡Æ∞‡Æø‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡Ææ-‡Æ≤ ‚ö°Ô∏èüîãüîå‡ÆÆ‡Æø‡Æ©‡Øç‡Æö‡Ææ‡Æ∞ ‡Æ®‡ØÜ‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡Æï‡Øç‡Æï‡Æü‡Æø. ‡Æ™‡Æ¥‡Øà‡ÆØ ‡Æ™‡Æµ‡Æ∞‡Øç

In this video we explore distributed locking mechanisms including centralized locking, token-based locking, and quorum-based locking, explaining their principles, advantages, and limitations.\n\nWe then look into Redis based Redlock, a widely adopted quorum-based locking algorithm that provides high availability and fault tolerance. We break down the Redlock algorithm step by step, highlighting how it leverages multiple Redis instances to achieve consensus on lock acquisition.\n\nThroughout the video, I emphasize the importance of distributed locking in maintaining data integrity and preventing conflicts in concurrent systems. \n\nWe also discuss real-world applications of distributed locking, such as managing inventory in e-commerce systems and coordinating access to shared resources in cloud environments.\n\nFOLLOW ME ON:\n‚ñ∂Ô∏è Main Channel:  /bytemonk  \n\nTimestamps - \n00:00 - Introduction\n01:11 - Distributed Lock\n01:55 - Optimistic vs. Distributed Locking\n03:14 - Ideal Distributed Locking\n03:41 - Distributed Locking Algorithms\n06:59 - Distributed Locking with Redis\n\n\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/bytemonk/\n\nSystem Design Interview Basics Playlist: \n‚ñ∫https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJq-63ZRPdBt423WbyAD1YZO0Ljo1pzvY\n\nAWS Certification: \n‚ñ∫AWS Certified Cloud Practioner: https://youtu.be/wF1pldkQrOY\n‚ñ∫AWS Certified Solution Architect Associate: https://youtu.be/GzomXNLFgkk\n‚ñ∫AWS Certified Solution Architect Professional: https://youtu.be/KFZrBxSA9tI\n\n#locking #redis #ai #optimistic",

        "description": "Earn Cash Back On Stocks: Up To $5,000 Per Year\nhttps://www.silomarkets.com/logic/\n\nStripe is one of the fastest-growing startups we‚Äôve seen in the mobile era. They‚Äôve grown from $0 to $1 trillion in annual payments processed within just 14 years. This is especially impressive given that they entered a highly competitive industry dominated by giants such as Mastercard, Visa, PayPal, and American Express. Yet, despite the odds, Stripe managed to grow to a valuation of nearly $100 billion. Their secret was simple: going after a different target market. They tailor-made Stripe to be extremely easy to use for developers. In fact, you only needed 7 lines of code to integrate Stripe into any website. Nowadays, they even have no code options. Aside from simplifying the integration process, Stripe targeted smaller websites and local stores that the bigger players generally overlooked. And as these businesses exploded in popularity, so did Stripe. This video explains the insane rise of Stripe and how Stripe became one of the most successful startups in the world. \n\nFree Weekly Newsletter With Insiders:\nhttps://logicallyanswered.co/\n\nSocials:\nhttps://www.instagram.com/hariharan.jayakumar/\n\nDiscord Community: \nhttps://discord.gg/SJUNWNt\n\nTimestamps:\n0:00 - Stripe\n1:15 - Humble Beginnings\n4:38 - The Genius Of Stripe\n7:24 - Organic Growth\n9:26 - Stripe‚Äôs Secret Sauce\n\nResources:\nhttps://pastebin.com/HJa5TLib\n\nDisclaimer:\nThis video is not a solicitation or personal financial advice.

But the path is filled with obstacles. What does India need to fix before it can take China‚Äôs crown? \n\nRead the full story: https://trib.al/Ubb7SZX\n\nHow Narendra Modi Took Power in India: https://youtu.be/FLQoCNzoT2o Originally published May 15, 2024\n\nNarendra Modi, India‚Äôs 73-year-old prime minister, is both highly popular and deeply polarizing. How did he work his way to the top of Indian politics, and what do his policies mean for the country‚Äôs future, both at home and on the world stage?\n\nBloomberg Originals speaks with childhood friends, government officials and former associates who have seen Modi up close over the years, seeking to understand how his core beliefs may have shaped his decision-making. We also show how he has sought to simultaneously make himself a champion of the poor and a friend to billionaires.\n\nSitting at the top of the world‚Äôs most populous nation and one of its fastest growing economies, Modi occupies a uniquely important and powerful position in geopolitics, global trade and finance ‚Äì especially as China‚Äôs growth has slowed. We explain how he got there, and what may come next.\n\nRead more about How Narendra Modi Is Preparing for a Thousand-Year Legacy on Bloomberg: https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-modi-legacy-india-elections/\n\nWhat This $200 Million Temple Says About Modi‚Äôs India: https://youtu.be/Dfxtx1Y0T9E Originally published January 19, 2024\n\nWhen Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurates the new Hindu temple in Ayodhya, many will see it as the capstone of his 10 years in power. Built on the site of a former mosque at a cost estimated at more than $200 million, the temple shows how his Bharatiya Janata Party has become a seemingly unstoppable electoral machine. And the timing of the inauguration, just months before national elections, may boost the election prospects of Modi and his fellow Hindu nationalists. \n\nInside Luxury‚Äôs Secret India Supply Chain: https://youtu.be/Qy2JWUOwTWQ Originally published September 28, 2023\n\nSome of your ‚ÄúMade in France‚Äù luxury items are actually made in India. For decades, fashion houses obscured their business ties to developing nations where labor is cheap, and hard-to-find handicraft skills plentiful.\n\nToday, credit sharing remains contested, even as laws tighten around transparency. We set out to investigate what‚Äôs behind a garment label.\n\nHow India's Drug Exports May Have a Safety Problem: https://youtu.be/3BoQsnqC5zM Originally published December 15, 2023\n\nHospitals around the world use drugs from a small but crucial Indian supplier. In Colombia four kids died and more than a hundred fell ill. In a months-long investigation, Bloomberg Businessweek found that, despite a track record of safety lapses and quality concerns, the manufacturer continued selling its drugs. \n\nRead the full story: http://www.trib.al/NPh1C4F\n\nInside Modi's Dangerous Bet on Alternative Medicine: https://youtu.be/msJOeyHQOoQ Originally published February 28, 2024\n\nIndia‚Äôs alternative medicine industry is booming as ancient principles of healthy living gain new traction, thanks in part to support from Narendra Modi‚Äôs government.  ‚ÄúAyurveda‚Äù, an ancient medical system that has existed in India for centuries, is flourishing with help from holistic-living influencers with vast reach on Instagram and YouTube. But there's a dark side to Ayurveda‚Äôs popularity.\n\nSome doctors in India are seeing patients suffer serious injuries from long term use of ayurvedic medicines. Medical professionals trying to raise awareness about the dangers of alternative medicines have faced lawsuits and even government intervention.\n\nIndia‚Äôs Obesity Time Bomb: https://youtu.be/VLZXmSToMi8 Originally published November 3, 2023\n\nAlmost 1 in 4 adults is considered overweight or obese in India. As junk food giants push into developing nations with weaker public health awareness, campaigners are calling for tougher regulation.\n\n#India #Economy #Documentary \n\nLike this video?

And that was true in 2022!!\n\nBut 2 months ago I saw this linkedin post by Shantanu deshpande who runs a company called the bombay shaving company and he said that they saw a day when they sold more products through blink it than they sold via amazon!! \n\nAnd it is so stunning to know this because, 2 years back blinkit sales were at 0% of amazon for bombay shaving company, a year back it was at 10% of amazon and now blink it sales are crossing 100% of amazon!! And the reason why its a big deal for people like you and me is because, Today if you have your brand was on amazon, it's no big deal because it's too crowded today, but 10 years back, if your brand was on amazon, you had the golden opportunity to achieve insane sales!! And this is where we saw the rise of giant companies like boat, mamaearth and Noise!! So just like amazon 10 years ago, today if you understand why blinkit and instamart are revolutionary, it could be a huge opportunity for you!!\n\nSo as usual, as a business nerd I got deep into every part of the quick commerce industry,  to find out what exactly has fundamentally changed in the quick commerce revolution of India and I found something absolutely mind blowing!!\nSo in this episode today, you are going get a sneak peak into one of the most valuable reports in the history Indian consumer market!!! And this report will tell you, \nHow on earth did a struggling unit like Blinkit start growing faster than zomato?\nhow did quick commerce go from being a landmine to a goldmine in just 2 years??\nWhy does it look like blinkti could beat a giant like amazon in the next 10 years?\nWhat is their business strategy that is making it possible?\nAnd most importantly, what are the business lessons that we need to learn from this blinkit vs amazon case study?\n\nOur Best Indian Business Case Studies:\n1.

        "description": "Compounding is a phenomenon that works wonders over time. It's like a snowball rolling down a hill, gathering more snow and growing larger as it goes. At its core, compounding involves earning returns on both the original investment and the returns that have already been generated. This creates a snowball effect where wealth accumulates exponentially over time.\n\nHere's how it works: let's say you invest Rs. 1000 in a stock or mutual fund that earns an annual return of 10%. In the first year, you earn Rs. 100 in returns, bringing your total investment to Rs. 1100. In the second year, you earn 10% on the entire Rs. 1100, not just the original Rs. 1000. This means you earn Rs. 110 in returns, bringing your total investment to Rs. 1210.\n\nAs the years go by, this process repeats itself, with your investment growing larger and larger with each passing year. The longer you leave your money invested, the more powerful compounding becomes. Over time, even small, regular investments can grow into significant sums.\n\nCompounding is often referred to as the \"eighth wonder of the world\" because of its remarkable ability to grow wealth over time. However, it's important to remember that compounding works best over long periods. It requires patience and discipline to let your investments grow and resist the temptation to withdraw your money prematurely.\n\nBy harnessing the power of compounding and staying invested for the long term, you can build wealth steadily and achieve your financial goals. So start early, invest regularly, and let the power of compounding work its magic for you.\n\nCompounding isn't just about finances; it's a principle applicable to life's many facets. Small, consistent efforts, like daily exercise, can compound into significant improvements in health. Similarly, acts of kindness in relationships build trust over time. Skill-building, with just 15 minutes of practice daily, leads to expertise. This universal principle underscores the power of consistency in achieving incremental gains. So, whether in finances or personal growth, embrace the compounding effect, and watch as steady efforts yield remarkable results across all areas of life.\n\nJoin Learner's Community : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmfl6VteCu880D8Txl4vEag/join\n\nCourses : https://www.financeboosan.in  \n\nWhatsapp Channel : https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va6xVGJ1iUxff71r8p23\nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/finance.boosan/\nOther useful links : https://beacons.ai/boosan\n_______________________________________________\nNew Account opening link  : \nZerodha  :  https://bit.ly/newZerodhaD\n\nVideo Editor : https://www.instagram.com/jagan_editor/\n_______________________________________________\n#financeBoosan #usefulinformationBoosan\nStock Market, Mutual Funds, Investments, Personal Finance, Make Money Online",

        "description": "Choosing the right partition key is crucial to achieving good performance and scalability in DynamoDB. \n\nHi Guys, this is Abi from Gokce DB and in this video, you are going to learn 5 things that you should know before choosing a partition key.\n\n1. A good partition key should have high cardinality, meaning that it should have a large number of distinct values. This ensures that the data is evenly distributed across the partitions, which results in better performance and scalability. Examples include emailid, employee_no, customerid, sessionid & orderid.\n\n2. Choose a partition key that will be frequently queried. The partition key is used to retrieve data from DynamoDB, so it should be chosen based on the most common queries that will be performed. If a partition key is rarely queried, it will result in uneven distribution of data and may lead to hot partitions, which can cause performance issues.\n\n3. Avoid using always increasing values as partition keys such as a timestamps. This can cause all new data to be written to the same partition, resulting in a hot partition. As mentioned earlier, uneven distribution of data can impact the performance of the database.\n\n4. Consider using composite partition keys which means you should try to combine more than one attribute to form a unique key. For example, you could use a combination of customer ID, product ID and country code as a composite partition key if that meets your access pattern.\n\n5. Cache popular items when there is a high volume of read traffic using Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator or DAX.  It is a fully managed, in-memory cache for DynamoDB that will prevent reads of unusually popular items from swamping partitions.\n\nRemember, you cannot change partition key after the table is created. \nBy following these best practices, you can choose a partition key that will optimize performance and scalability in Amazon DynamoDB.",

Or...\nA video is a bunch of images. 10 minutes is 600 seconds. Each second has 24 frames. So a video has 25*600 = 150,000 frames.\n Each frame is of size 1 MB. Which means (1.5 * 10^5) * (10^6) bytes = 150 GB.\nThis estimate is very inaccurate, and hence we must either revise our estimate or hope the interviewer corrects us. Normal video of 10 minutes is about 700 MB.\n\nAs each video is of about 1GB, we assume the storage requirement per day is 1GB * 1 million = 1 PB. \n\nThis is the bare minimum storage requirement to store the original videos. If we want to have redundancy for fault tolerance and performance, we have to store copies. I'll choose 3 copies. \nThat's 3 petabytes of raw data storage.\nWhat about video formats and encoding? Let's assume a single type of encoding, mp4, and the formats will take a 720p video and store it in 480, 360, 240 and 144p respectively. That means approximately half the video size per codec.\n\nIf X is the original storage requirement = 1 PB,\nWe have X + X/2 + X/4 + X/8 == 2*X.\nWith redundancy, that's 2X * 3 = 6*X.\n\nThat's 6 PB(processed) + 3PB (raw)  == 10 PB of data. About 100 hard drives. The cost of this system is about 1 million per day.\n\nFor a 3 year plan, we can expect a 1 billion dollar storage price.\n\nNow let's look at the real numbers:\nVideo upload speed = 3 * 10^4 minutes per minute.\nThat's 3 * 10^4 *1440 video footage per day =  4.5 * 10^7 minutes.\nVideo encoding can reduce a 1-hour film to 1 GB. So 1 million GB is the requirement. That's 1 PB.\n\nSo the original cost is similar to what the real numbers say.\n\n\nIf we are off by order of magnitude, it's good. However, being off by 3 or more orders of magnitude is too much. We can then highlight the following:\nWhere our assumption was wrong, or \nWhich factor we didn't take into account. \n\nReferences:\nDesigning Data-Intensive Applications - https://amzn.to/2yQIrxH\nhttp://highscalability.com/youtube-architecture\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5WVu624fY8\nNumbers everyone should know: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=modXC5IWTJI\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-lGCC4KKok\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-of-the-envelope_calculation\nCapacity planning with AWS: https://youtu.be/-3qetLv2Yp0\n\nSystem Design Course: \nhttps://interviewready.io/\n\nAlong with video lectures, this course has architecture diagrams, capacity planning, API contracts and evaluation tests.

        "description": "Norway has had massive success with EV adoption, with 82% of new cars sold in the country last year being electric. This high adoption rate can be attributed to the generous subsidies that Norway has offered to electric vehicle owners as well as the country‚Äôs investment in charging infrastructure. Tesla‚Äôs sales in Norway represent only a sliver of the 1.8 million vehicles the company delivered last year, but Norway‚Äôs importance to Tesla goes beyond cold hard cash. Tesla‚Äôs early foothold in the country has made Norway the perfect proving ground for the company and acted as a poster child for the EV transition as a whole. As a result, Tesla CEO, Elon Musk has taken a number of trips to the small Nordic country and has often praised Norway‚Äôs support of electric vehicles. Norwegians were the first European customers to receive deliveries of the Model S in 2013 and it quickly became the country‚Äôs best-selling car. Today, that title has been transferred over to Tesla‚Äôs Model Y. But with competition from other EV cars from automakers including Toyota, Skoda, Volkswagan and BYD heating up, it remains to be seen if Norwegians will continue to choose Tesla in the future.

        "description": "Yemen's Houthis say they're avenging Gaza. But there's a lot more to it.\n\nHelp keep Vox free for everybody: http://www.vox.com/give-now \n\nAfter the Israel-Hamas war broke out on October 7, 2023, the Houthis, a Yemeni rebel group, began attacking ships passing through the Red Sea. The Houthis pledged to attack any ship in these waters that does business with Israel, to protest Israel‚Äôs war on Gaza and to show solidarity with Palestinians there. But as the attacks have continued, another motive for them has become apparent: strengthening the Houthis‚Äô control of Yemen. \n\nAfter a nine-year civil war, the Houthis today control a sizable area in Yemen, with over 70 percent of the Yemeni population within the group‚Äôs territory. The conflict has devastated the country, creating one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world. More than 377,000 Yemenis have been killed ‚Äî by airstrikes from a Saudi-led coalition; landmines and detonations planted by the Houthis; a lack of medical services; and scarcity of food and water due to a naval blockade. And both the Saudi-led coalition and the Houthis have been accused of committing war crimes against Yemenis.\n\nToday, the Houthis are attempting to establish themselves as Yemen's legitimate leaders in the eyes of Yemenis, though they‚Äôve done little to improve the country‚Äôs humanitarian crisis. The Red Sea attacks, which appear to have significant support among the Yemeni people, might be a means to achieve that goal.\n\nSubscribe to our channel and turn on notifications (üîî) so you don't miss any videos: http://goo.gl/0bsAjO\n\n00:00 The Red Sea attacks\n1:09 Saleh and the Zaydis\n3:19 The Arab Spring\n4:24 Civil war\n7:23 Ceasefire talks\n8:23 Legitimacy\n\nSources and further reading:\n\nBack in 2018, we produced a video on how the Saudi-led coalition uses weapons made by the United States to target Yemenis.

        "description": "Stock Market: Strategies, Pitfalls, and Solutions\n\nInvesting in stocks can be thrilling yet challenging. Many investors face hurdles like timing the market, emotional attachments to companies, and neglecting diversification. Let‚Äôs delve into these pitfalls and ways to overcome them.\n\nTiming the Market:\nTrying to predict market movements is risky. Instead, focus on long-term investments. Regular contributions and diversification can help mitigate market volatility.\n\nNot Understanding the Business:\nInvesting without understanding a company‚Äôs fundamentals is akin to gambling. Thorough research is crucial. Analyze the business model, financials, and industry dynamics before investing.\n\nI Love the Company:\nEmotional attachment can cloud judgment. Base investment decisions on objective analysis rather than feelings.\n\nAveraging Down:\nBuying more shares as the stock price drops can be tempting, but it can lead to further losses. Reevaluate the investment thesis before averaging down.\n\nTunnel Vision: My Price, My Portfolio:\nFocusing solely on target prices or allocations can lead to missed opportunities. Stay flexible and adapt to changing market conditions.\n\nLooking Only at Stock Price:\nStock prices may not reflect a company‚Äôs true value. Conduct fundamental analysis to assess a company‚Äôs health and prospects.\n\nPenny Stock Speculation:\nInvesting in penny stocks can be risky due to volatility and speculation. Allocate only a small portion of your portfolio to speculative investments and conduct thorough research.\n\nAllocation Problem:\nProper asset allocation is crucial for managing risk. Diversify across different asset classes and sectors to optimize returns.\n\nWaiting to Get Even: The Biggest Blunder:\nHolding onto losing investments indefinitely can hinder portfolio growth. Cut losses and reallocate funds to better opportunities.\n\nHow to Mitigate:\n\nWhy Are You Even Doing This?: \nAlign your investment strategy with your goals, time horizon, and risk tolerance.\n\nAutomate: Implement automatic investment plans like dollar-cost averaging to maintain discipline.\n\nPlay Part: Stay informed but acknowledge that not every market movement can be predicted. Focus on disciplined, diversified, long-term investing.\n\nIn conclusion, understanding common pitfalls and implementing mitigation strategies can help investors navigate the stock market more effectively, increasing their chances of achieving long-term financial success.\nJoin Learner's Community : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmfl6VteCu880D8Txl4vEag/join\n\nCourses : https://www.financeboosan.in  \n\nWhatsapp Channel : https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va6xVGJ1iUxff71r8p23\nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/finance.boosan/\nOther useful links : https://beacons.ai/boosan\n_______________________________________________\nNew Account opening link  : \nZerodha  :  https://bit.ly/newZerodhaD\n\nVideo Editor : https://www.instagram.com/jagan_editor/\n_______________________________________________\n#financeboosan  #stockmarketindia #investing \nStock Market, Mutual Funds, Investments, Personal Finance, Make Money Online",

        "title": "BEST INDEX to invest for 15-20 years? Nifty LargeMidcap 250 Index | Complete Review",
        "description": "The Nifty Large Midcap 250 Index offers several advantages over other indices:\n\nBalanced Exposure: It provides a balanced exposure to both large-cap and mid-cap segments, mitigating the risk associated with either segment's performance. This balanced approach ensures that investors benefit from the stability of large-cap stocks while also tapping into the growth potential of mid-cap stocks.\n\nDiversification: By equally allocating investments between large-cap and mid-cap companies, the index fund offers diversification across various companies, sectors, and market capitalizations. This diversification helps spread risk and potentially enhances returns over the long term.\n\nOptimized Allocation: The index fund invests your money equally between the top 100 large companies and the next 150 midcap companies. This allocation strategy is optimized to capture opportunities across both segments of the market, maximizing the potential for returns while minimizing risk.\n\nHistorical Performance: Over various time horizons, the Nifty LargeMidcap 250 Index has demonstrated strong performance relative to other indices such as the Nifty 100 Index and the Nifty Midcap 150 Index. It has outperformed the Nifty 100 Index across multiple long-term periods, indicating its ability to generate superior returns over time.\n\nReturn-Risk Ratio: The index exhibits a higher return-risk ratio compared to the Nifty 100 Index over both short and long-term horizons. This suggests that investors can potentially achieve higher returns for a given level of risk by investing in the Nifty LargeMidcap 250 Index compared to the Nifty 100 Index.\n\nOverall, the Nifty LargeMidcap 250 Index offers investors a well-rounded investment opportunity, combining the stability of large-cap stocks with the growth potential of mid-cap stocks, along with the benefits of diversification and historical performance.\n\nHistorically over a long term this has outperformed Nifty 50 significantly. \n----\nJoin Learner's Community : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmfl6VteCu880D8Txl4vEag/join\n----\nStock Market Courses : https://www.financeboosan.in  \n----\nWhatsapp Channel : https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va6xVGJ1iUxff71r8p23\nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/finance.boosan/\nOther useful links : https://beacons.ai/boosan\n_______________________________________________\nNew Account opening link  : \nZerodha  :  https://bit.ly/newZerodhaD\n\nVideo Editor : https://www.instagram.com/jagan_editor/\n_______________________________________________\n#financeBoosan #usefulinformationBoosan\nStock Market, Mutual Funds, Investments, Personal Finance, Make Money Online",

        "title": "2X your money in 4 years? | Rule of 72",
        "description": "2X your money every 4 years | Rule of 72\nThe Rule of 72 is an easy-to-use formula designed to estimate the time needed for an investment to double its value, given a specific rate of return. This rule is particularly useful with compounded interest rates and tends to be most accurate for rates between 6% and 10%. Beyond investments, the Rule of 72 can also be applied to other areas experiencing exponential growth, such as GDP or inflation rates. It's helpful in understanding the long-term impacts of annual fees on the growth of investments. Additionally, the Rule of 72 can assist in calculating the rate of return necessary for an investment to double within a set time frame. In various circumstances, alternative rules like the Rule of 69, Rule of 70, or Rule of 73 might offer more precision.\n\nHow Do You Calculate the Rule of 72?\nThe Rule of 72 is a straightforward way to estimate how long it will take for an investment to double in value. Simply divide 72 by the investment's expected annual return rate to get the number of years it will approximately take for your investment to double.\n\nFor example, if you have an investment opportunity that promises an 8% annual compounded rate of return, it will take about nine years (72 / 8 = 9) for the investment to double. This means, if you invest ‚Çπ10,000 at this rate, your investment will grow to ‚Çπ20,000 in 9 years, ‚Çπ40,000 in 18 years, ‚Çπ80,000 in 27 years, and so on.\n\nBook 1-1 video call : https://topmate.io/finance_boosan\nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/finance.boosan/\nJoin Learner's Community : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmfl6VteCu880D8Txl4vEag/join\nOther useful links : https://beacons.ai/boosan\n_______________________________________________\nNew Account opening links for leading brokers in India : \nPaytm Money  : https://paytmmoney.onelink.me/9L59/of8ow3sl\nGroww :  https://bit.ly/growwNew\nm.Stock :  https://bit.ly/mstockNew\nZerodha  :  https://bit.ly/newZerodhaD\n\n^ leading brokers in India if you're interested in opening a new broker account.\n(above are my affiliate links)\n_______________________________________________\n#financeBoosan #usefulinformationBoosan\nStock Market, Mutual Funds, Investments, Personal Finance, Make Money Online",

        "description": "Thirty years ago, Taiwan immigrant Jensen Huang founded Nvidia with the dream of revolutionizing PCs and gaming with 3D graphics. In 1999, after laying off the majority of workers and nearly going bankrupt, the company succeeded when it launched what it claims as the world‚Äôs first Graphics Processing Unit (GPU). Then Jensen bet the company on something entirely different: AI. Now, that bet is paying off in a big way as Nvidia‚Äôs A100 chips quickly become the coveted training engines for ChatGPT and other generative AI. But as the chip shortage eases, other chip giants like Intel are struggling. And with all it‚Äôs chips made by TSMC in Taiwan, Nvidia remains vulnerable to mounting U.S.-China trade tensions. We went to Nvidia‚Äôs Silicon Valley, California, headquarters to talk with Huang and get a behind-the scenes-look at the chips powering gaming and the AI boom.\n\nChapters: \n02:04 ‚Äî Chapter 1: Popularizing the GPU\n07:02 ‚Äî Chapter 2: From graphics to AI and ChatGPT\n11:52 ‚Äî Chapter 3: Geopolitics and other concerns\n14:31 ‚Äî Chapter 4: Amazon, autonomous cars and beyond\n\nProduced and shot by: Katie Tarasov\nEdited by: Evan Lee Miller\nAdditional Camera: Andrew Evers\nSupervising Producer: Jeniece Pettitt\nGraphics by: Jason Reginato\n\n¬ª Subscribe to CNBC: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBC\n¬ª Subscribe to CNBC TV: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCtelevision\n¬ª Subscribe to CNBC Classic: https://cnb.cx/SubscribeCNBCclassic\n\nAbout CNBC: From 'Wall Street' to 'Main Street' to award winning original documentaries and Reality TV series, CNBC has you covered.

Emergency Fund:\n   - Purpose: It serves as a financial safety net in unforeseen circumstances like job loss, medical emergencies, or urgent home repairs.\n   - How much to save: Generally, it's recommended to have enough to cover 3-6 months of living expenses.\n   - Where to keep it: This fund should be easily accessible, ideally in a high-yield savings account or a liquid fund.\n\n2. Term Insurance:\n   - What it is: Term insurance is a type of life insurance that provides coverage at a fixed rate of payments for a limited period. \n   - Importance: It's crucial for those with financial dependents to ensure their family‚Äôs financial security in case of the policyholder's untimely demise.\n\n3. Health Insurance:\n   - Why it's needed: Health insurance covers medical expenses, which can be financially devastating without coverage.\n   - What to consider: Look for a policy with a sufficient cover, considering factors like family health history, coverage for critical illnesses, and network hospitals.\n\n4. Repay Your Debts:\n   - Strategy: Prioritize high-interest debts like credit card balances. Consider debt consolidation or refinancing for better interest rates.\n   - Importance: Reducing debt lowers financial risk and interest expenses, freeing up more money for investments.\n\nNext, consider your investment strategy based on risk appetite, investment goals, and time horizon. Here are major categories to consider:\n\n1. Fixed or Recurring Deposits:\n   - Characteristics: Safe, predictable returns, best for short-term goals.\n   - Consideration: Generally offer lower returns compared to other investment types.\n\n2. Mutual Funds:\n   - Types: Equity-Linked Savings Scheme (ELSS) for tax-saving, Index Funds for passive investing - Active Funds for high risk appetite individuals.\n   - Benefits: Diversification, professional management, suitable for a range of investment goals.\n\n3. Gold:\n   - Options: Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGB), Gold Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), and Gold Mutual Funds.\n   - Role in Portfolio: Acts as a hedge against inflation and market volatility.\n\n4. Bonds:\n   - What they are: Debt instruments where an investor loans money to an entity (corporate or governmental) that borrows the funds for a defined period at a fixed interest rate.\n   - Risk and Return: Generally safer than stocks but with lower potential returns.\n\n5. Real Estate:\n   - Investment in property: Can be for rental income or capital appreciation.\n   - Considerations: Requires significant capital, subject to market risks and liquidity concerns.\n\n6. Direct Stocks:\n   - What it entails: Buying shares of individual companies.\n   - Considerations: High risk and high potential returns, requires market knowledge and active management.\n\n\nAll in one Playlist :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgb4aazT9mz9nDv7OkhW8EabBK0IF9XY2\n\n\nDo this Before investing :\nhttps://youtu.be/POaW7B3J0LI?si=dVVpktN3To8fvn-Z\nhttps://youtu.be/MybInIGu29w?si=GSI6WrooUfmryC6C\nhttps://youtu.be/dY2cXsyvphI?si=HJaud6Ix5L4hiVVP\nhttps://youtu.be/p0RyfYnScZc?si=DiMBWRlzIu-zRPUh\n\nMutual Funds\nhttps://youtu.be/NoN1lkbvVLk?si=SsHIVwJYbm2hZDfe\nhttps://youtu.be/4C_kneqABA8?si=LbBxO3oUnjrpftWK\nhttps://youtu.be/qkBk2V92Ru0?si=TaFx6bldl-_dG0mK\nhttps://youtu.be/lnZJYbmgyfk?si=-L15CcwnG3Ivl0V8\nhttps://youtu.be/h3UDtFnw5as?si=msJc7xFrmhR-UPxl\nhttps://youtu.be/B1TQ6Z0M1ac?si=R_kT91-mGVxHfSzY\n\nGold\nhttps://youtu.be/F4fHYZc-O6E?si=47ZdCn0hgCZ038N0\n\nBonds\nhttps://youtu.be/hxDrKQf8vWE?si=X-8VOUhWzYfG9CrB\n\nStocks\nhttps://youtu.be/ejKlSMrLPJw?si=YwEX3Rn0I3tsPBLN\n\nChapters\n0:00 Intro\n0:11 Why Invest?\n2:01 Do this before investing\n5:46 Which type are you?\n6:32 FD/RD\n7:22 Mutual Funds\n11:15 Gold\n13:15 Bonds\n14:29 Real estate\n16:38 Stocks\n\n----\nJoin Learner's Community : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmfl6VteCu880D8Txl4vEag/join\n----\nStock Market Courses : https://www.financeboosan.in  \n----\nWhatsapp Channel : https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va6xVGJ1iUxff71r8p23\nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/finance.boosan/\nOther useful links : https://beacons.ai/boosan\n_______________________________________________\nNew Account opening links for leading brokers in India : \nPaytm Money  : https://paytmmoney.onelink.me/9L59/of8ow3sl\nGroww :  https://bit.ly/growwNew\nm.Stock :  https://bit.ly/mstockNew\nZerodha  :  https://bit.ly/newZerodhaD\n\n^ leading brokers in India if you're interested in opening a new broker account.\n(above are my affiliate links)\n\nVideo Editor : https://www.instagram.com/jagan_editor/\n_______________________________________________",

        "description": "Learn Basic Of Stock Market Investments at https://www.financeboosan.in \nBuy Term Insurance & Get Online Discount Up to 10%üëáhttp://tinyurl.com/ycy8st2y\n\nBuy Health Insurance & Get up to 25% Discount üëáhttp://tinyurl.com/96cpjr7a\n‚Çπ1 Cr health plan at ‚Çπ390/ month\n\n‚ÄéFollow the Finance Boosan channel on WhatsApp: https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va6xVGJ1iUxff71r8p23\n\n\n3x Monthly Income Rule: Aim to save or invest at least three times your monthly income each year. For instance, if you earn 40K per month, you should have saved or invested 1.2L by year-end. This represents a 25% savings rate, which is slightly below the average savings rate in India (30.2%) but still substantial to start with.\n\n5 Day Rule: Invest or save at least 25% of your income within five days of receiving your paycheck. This can be automated through SIPs (Systematic Investment Plans), RDs (Recurring Deposits), or SSYs (Sukanya Samriddhi Yojanas). For those with irregular income, the key is to invest within five days of receiving the majority of your income.\n\n‚Äú3‚Äù before ‚Äú3‚Äù Rule: Prioritize having an emergency fund, term insurance, and health insurance before investing. An emergency fund should be equivalent to three times your monthly expenses and kept in highly liquid forms like a bank FD or savings account.\n\n40% EMI Debt Repayment Rule: Your EMI (Equated Monthly Installment) or debt payments should not exceed 40% of your total income. If your EMIs are too high, the recommendation is to increase your income to keep the EMI within 40% of your income.\n\n16 EMI Rule: To quickly pay off loans, aim to pay 16 EMIs per year instead of the usual 12. This can significantly reduce the total interest paid and the loan period.\n\n25X Rule: Ensure your term insurance coverage is at least 25 times your annual expenses. This amount of coverage ensures sufficient funds for many years, accounting for inflation and lifestyle maintenance.\n\nRule of 72: This rule helps estimate the time it takes for an investment to double at a given annual rate of return. For example, at a 12% return rate, it would take about 6 years to double the investment.\n\n----\nJoin Learner's Community : https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmfl6VteCu880D8Txl4vEag/join\n----\nStock Market Courses : https://www.financeboosan.in  \n----\nWhatsapp Channel : https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029Va6xVGJ1iUxff71r8p23\nInstagram : https://www.instagram.com/finance.boosan/\nOther useful links : https://beacons.ai/boosan\n \n_______________________________________________\n#financeBoosan #usefulinformationBoosan\nStock Market, Mutual Funds, Investments, Personal Finance, Make Money Online\n\n\nLearn Basic Of Stock Market Investments at https://www.financeboosan.in \n\n#healthinsurance #insurance #health #healthcare #financialplanning #covid #healthissues #medicalemergency #medicare #financialfreedom #money #medicalinsurance  #insuranceclaimc #mediclaim #privatehealthinsurance #corporatehealthinsurance #onlinehealthinsurance #onlinehealthpolicy #Medicalcover #Savemedicalbill  #Savemedicalexpenses #freetreatment #policybazaar \n\n\n#lifeinsurance #insurance #financialplanning #financialfreedom #lifeinsuranceagent #investment #money #life #protection #financialliteracy #insurancepolicy #covid #insurancequote #incomeprotection #terminsurance #wealth #financialservices #personalfinance #insurancelife #financialindependence #termInsurance #TermPlan #Termlifeinsurance #OnlineInsurance #BestTermInsurance #Besttermplan #OnlinelifeInsurance #Nocostterminsurance #zerocosttermPlan",

The Mate 60 Pro appeared to be more advanced than should have been possible, given import controls imposed by the US Department of Commerce.

        "description": "The Stuntman becomes the hero. #TheFallGuyMovie only in theaters May 3.\n\n------\n\nHe‚Äôs a stuntman, and like everyone in the stunt community, he gets blown up, shot, crashed, thrown through windows and dropped from the highest of heights, all for our entertainment. And now, fresh off an almost career-ending accident, this working-class hero has to track down a missing movie star, solve a conspiracy and try to win back the love of his life while still doing his day job. What could possibly go right? \n\nFrom real life stunt man and director David Leitch, the blockbuster director of Bullet Train, Deadpool 2, Atomic Blonde and Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw and the producer of John Wick, Nobody and Violent Night, comes his most personal film yet. A new hilarious, hard-driving, all-star apex-action thriller and love letter to action movies and the hard-working and under-appreciated crew of people who make them: The Fall Guy. \n\nOscar¬Æ nominee Ryan Gosling (Barbie, La La Land, Drive) stars as Colt Seavers, a battle-scarred stuntman who, having left the business a year earlier to focus on both his physical and mental health, is drafted back into service when the star of a mega-budget studio movie‚Äîbeing directed by his ex, Jody Moreno, played by Golden Globe winner Emily Blunt (Oppenheimer, A Quiet Place films, Sicario)‚Äîgoes missing.\n\nWhile the film‚Äôs ruthless producer (Emmy winner Hannah Waddingham; Ted Lasso), maneuvers to keep the disappearance of star Tom Ryder (Golden Globe winner Aaron Taylor-Johnson; Bullet Train) a secret from the studio and the media, Colt performs the film‚Äôs most outrageous stunts while trying (with limited success) to charm his way back into Jody‚Äôs good graces. But as the mystery around the missing star deepens, Colt will find himself ensnared in a sinister, criminal plot that will push him to the edge of a fall more dangerous than any stunt.\n\nInspired by the hit 1980s TV series, The Fall Guy also stars Winston Duke (Black Panther franchise) and Academy Award¬Æ nominee Stephanie Hsu (Everything Everywhere All at Once). \n\nFrom a screenplay by Hobbs & Shaw screenwriter Drew Pearce, The Fall Guy is produced by Kelly McCormick (Bullet Train, Nobody, Atomic Blonde) and David Leitch for their company 87North, and by Ryan Gosling and by Guymon Casady (Game of Thrones, Steve Jobs and executive producer of the upcoming series Ripley) for Entertainment 360. The film is executive produced by Drew Pearce, Entertainment 360‚Äôs Geoff Shaevitz and the creator of the original Fall Guy television series, Glen A. Larson.\n\nWebsite: http://www.TheFallGuyMovie.com\nInstagram: http://www.instagram.com/thefallguymovie \nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/thefallguymovie \nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@Universalpics \nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/@UniversalPictures\nX: https://twitter.com/thefallguymovie",

What does that mean? Well, you can have high standards and strive for excellence, but also know that you‚Äôre only human and only have so much you can fit in your mind (‚Äòcognitive load‚Äô) 7 into your life. And guess what‚Ä¶ mistakes come with the territory!‚Å£\n‚Å£\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Don‚Äôt focus on the Gap between Current Self & Ideal Self‚Å£\n‚Å£\nOne of the reasons why you feel this ‚Äòguilt‚Äô is that you‚Äôre not where you want to be. You have this vision of your ‚Äòideal‚Äô self which is more disciplined, more successful, more of who you want to be‚Ä¶ and you become fixated on the giant gap between this state and where you actually are. Instead of looking at the gap, focus on what you‚Äôre doing each day to take one small step closer to the goal state.‚Å£\n‚Å£\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Prioritize rest‚Å£\n‚Å£\nOne big mistake you might be making if you‚Äôve fallen into the trap of productivity guilt is that you keep pushing to the point of diminishing returns. You‚Äôre no longer ‚Äòproductive‚Äô, but you don‚Äôt stop (‚Äòhello guilt!‚Äô). Yet, if you just took the time to rest, charge your body & replenish your mental battery, get this - you‚Äôd be even MORE productive, getting more done in less time!‚Å£\n‚Å£\nWhat about you? Have you experienced productivity guilt?‚Å£\n---------------\n\nFree training for professional women: https://www.shadezahrai.com/audio-training\n\nTo find out more about Shad√©, visit the website: https://www.shadezahrai.com\n\nFollow her on: \n\n‚Ä¢ Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/shadezahrai/\n‚Ä¢ TikTok:¬†¬†https://www.tiktok.com/@shadezahrai\n‚Ä¢ Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/shadezahraispeaker\n‚Ä¢ LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/shadezahrai\n\nJoin her private FB group for professional women: https://www.facebook.com/groups/neurofemina/",

Tom and Dick began performing as a duo in the late 1950s, playing in coffeehouses and clubs in San Francisco. Their act consisted of music, comedy, and witty banter, which quickly gained them a following.\n\nThe Smothers Brothers became a household name in the late 1960s with their variety show, The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. The show was groundbreaking in its approach to comedy, pushing the boundaries with political satire and social commentary. The show also featured up-and-coming musical acts, including The Doors and The Who, and introduced the world to comedians like Steve Martin and George Carlin.\n\nThe Smothers Brothers' irreverent style has made them a beloved and enduring force in American comedy. \n\nClown Jewels: \nOfficial Website: https://clownjewels.com/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@clownjewels\nFacebook: https://ClownJewels.lnk.to/FacebookID\nTikTok: https://ClownJewels.lnk.to/TikTokID\nInstagram: https://ClownJewels.lnk.to/InstagramID\nTwitter: https://ClownJewels.lnk.to/TwitterID\n\n800 Pound Gorilla: \nOfficial Website: https://800poundgorillamedia.com/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/@800pgm\nFacebook: https://800PGR.lnk.to/FacebookID\nTikTok: https://800PGR.lnk.to/TikTokID\nInstagram: https://800PGR.lnk.to/InstagramID\nTwitter: https://800PGR.lnk.to/TwitterID\n\n#smothersbrothers #Gallagher, #standup",

Now, they confront the most lethal opponent they‚Äôve ever faced: A terrifying threat emerging from the shadows of the past who‚Äôs fueled by blood revenge, and who is determined to shatter this family and destroy everything‚Äîand everyone‚Äîthat Dom loves, forever.  \n \nIn 2011‚Äôs Fast Five, Dom and his crew took out nefarious Brazilian drug kingpin Hernan Reyes and decapitated his empire on a bridge in Rio De Janeiro. What they didn‚Äôt know was that Reyes‚Äô son, Dante (Aquaman‚Äôs Jason Momoa), witnessed it all and has spent the last 12 years masterminding a plan to make Dom pay the ultimate price. \n \nDante‚Äôs plot will scatter Dom‚Äôs family from Los Angeles to the catacombs of Rome, from Brazil to London and from Portugal to Antarctica. New allies will be forged and old enemies will resurface. But everything changes when Dom discovers that his own 8-year-old son (Leo Abelo Perry, Black-ish) is the ultimate target of Dante‚Äôs vengeance. \n \nDirected by Louis Leterrier (Clash of the Titans, The Incredible Hulk), Fast X stars returning cast members Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris ‚ÄúLudacris‚Äù Bridges, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Jason Statham, John Cena and Scott Eastwood, with Oscar¬Æ winner Helen Mirren and Oscar¬Æ winner Charlize Theron. \n \nThe film also features an extraordinary new cast including Oscar¬Æ winner Brie Larson as Tess, a rogue representative from the Agency; Alan Richtson (Reacher) as Aimes, the new head of the Agency who doesn‚Äôt hold the same fondness for Dom‚Äôs crew as his predecessor, Mr. Nobody; Daniela Melchior (The Suicide Squad) as a Brazilian street racer with a powerful tie to Dom‚Äôs past; and legendary Oscar¬Æ winner Rita Moreno as Dom and Mia‚Äôs Abuelita Toretto. \n \nFast X is produced by Neal H. Moritz, Vin Diesel, Justin Lin, Jeff Kirschenbaum and Samantha Vincent. The executive producers are Joseph M. Caracciolo, Jr., David Cain, Chris Morgan, Amanda Lewis and Mark Bomback. www.thefastsaga.com\n\nOfficial Website: https://www.fastxmovie.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TheFastSaga\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/TheFastSaga\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TheFastSaga\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@thefastsaga",

Pictures presents ‚ÄúThe Flash,‚Äù directed by Andy Muschietti (the ‚ÄúIT‚Äù films, ‚ÄúMama‚Äù). Ezra Miller reprises their role as Barry Allen in the DC Super Hero‚Äôs first-ever standalone feature film.\n\nWorlds collide in ‚ÄúThe Flash‚Äù when Barry uses his superpowers to travel back in time in order to change the events of the past. But when his attempt to save his family inadvertently alters the future, Barry becomes trapped in a reality in which General Zod has returned, threatening annihilation, and there are no Super Heroes to turn to. That is, unless Barry can coax a very different Batman out of retirement and rescue an imprisoned Kryptonian‚Ä¶ albeit not the one he‚Äôs looking for. Ultimately, to save the world that he is in and return to the future that he knows, Barry‚Äôs only hope is to race for his life. But will making the ultimate sacrifice be enough to reset the universe? \n\n‚ÄúThe Flash‚Äù ensemble also includes rising star Sasha Calle, Michael Shannon (‚ÄúBullet Train,‚Äù ‚ÄúBatman v Superman: Dawn of Justice‚Äù), Ron Livingston (‚ÄúLoudermilk,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Conjuring‚Äù), Maribel Verd√∫ (‚ÄúElite,‚Äù ‚ÄúY tu mam√° tambi√©n‚Äù), Kiersey Clemons (‚ÄúZack Snyder‚Äôs Justice League,‚Äù ‚ÄúSweetheart‚Äù), Antje Traue (‚ÄúKing of Ravens,‚Äù ‚ÄúMan of Steel‚Äù) and Michael Keaton (‚ÄúSpider-Man: Homecoming,‚Äù ‚ÄúBatman‚Äù).\n\n‚ÄúThe Flash‚Äù is produced by Barbara Muschietti (the ‚ÄúIT‚Äù films, ‚ÄúMama‚Äù) and Michael Disco (‚ÄúRampage,‚Äù ‚ÄúSan Andreas‚Äù).

The executive producers \nare Toby Emmerich, Walter Hamada, Galen Vaisman and Marianne Jenkins.\n\nJoining director Muschietti behind the camera are director of photography Henry Braham (‚ÄúGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Suicide Squad‚Äù), production designer Paul Denham Austerberry (‚ÄúIT Chapter Two,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe Shape of Water‚Äù), editors Jason Ballantine (the ‚ÄúIT‚Äù films, ‚ÄúThe Great Gatsby‚Äù) and Paul Machliss (‚ÄúThe Gentlemen,‚Äù ‚ÄúBaby Driver‚Äù), and costume designer Alexandra Byrne (‚ÄúDoctor Strange,‚Äù ‚ÄúGuardians of the Galaxy‚Äù); the score is by Benjamin Wallfisch \n(‚ÄúThe Invisible Man,‚Äù the ‚ÄúIT‚Äù films).\n\nWarner Bros.
